Abstract = {Reverse logistics is becoming more important in overall industry area
   owing to the environmental and economic factors. Planning and building a
   reasonable reverse logistics system could bring more profit, customer

   aims to reduce resources consumption and environmental pollution, and to
   promote economical, social and ecological environment development.},

Title = {Energy-efficient scheduling for an energy-intensive industry under
   punitive electricity price},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {373},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {As global warming and climate change become more and more serious,
   governments and scholars are paying more and more attention to these
   problems. Considering that consumption in manufacturing accounts for
   about one-half of the world's total energy consumption, the industrial
   sector is extremely important for preventing global warming. Facing with
   a multi-objective scheduling problem in the energy-intensive industries
   under punitive electricity price, a hybrid flow shop scheduling problem
   with onsite PV power generation and battery system is proposed. An
   improved multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition
   is adopted, which integrates the low-carbon method with existing
   algorithms in three stages. First, an enhanced NEH heuristic algorithm
   is used to improve the quantity of initial solution in the
   initialization. Then the right-shift and speed scaling method are
   adapted to reduce the total energy consumption without affecting the
   maximum completion time. In the third stage, the distribution of
   renewable energy is performed, and the renewable energy is rescheduled
   based on the electricity range. The result of random instances and
   critical peak pricing verify the effectiveness of the proposed study.},

Title = {Changes in CO2 emissions from China's energy-intensive industries: a
   subsystem input-output decomposition analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {98-109},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {This paper presents a subsystem input-output model to analyse the
   patterns behind the evolution of CO2 emissions in energy-intensive
   industries. Two emissions accounting principles (the production
   accounting principle and the consumption accounting principle) are
   applied. The embodied CO2 emissions are divided into the
   production-based CO2 emissions associated with three components
   (internal component (IC), external component (EC) and demand level
   component (DLC)) in addition to the CO2 emissions identified by the
   indirect component (INC) from a consumption perspective. A structural
   decomposition analysis is further conducted to decompose the emissions
   changes into 3 effects, which are the emissions intensity effect (ET),
   the technological effect (TT ) and the demand effect (DT). The results
   show that the external component is primarily responsible for increased
   CO2 emissions and the demand effect is the key factor in the decrease of
   CO2 emissions. Moreover, sectors with a positive difference between
   production-based and consumption-based emissions are more sensitive than
   the others to the technological changes. Thus, different measures should
   be adopted by considering sectorial realities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd..

Title = {A decomposition analysis of energy-related CO2 emissions in Chinese six
   high-energy intensive industries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {184},
Pages = {1102-1112},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {China's six high-energy intensive industries use more energy than any
   other industrial sectors, consuming almost 90\% of manufacturing energy
   and more than 50\% of national energy and contributing over 50\% of
   national energy-related CO2 emissions. Thus, this study is motivated to
   identify the drivers of energy-related CO2 emissions change of
   high-energy intensive industries in China based on the Logarithmic Mean
   Divisia Index (LMDI) method. Results demonstrate that CO2 emissions in
   China's high-energy intensive industries were on the rise during
   1986-2013 with annual growth rate of 7.8\%. The expansion of industrial
   scale, which increased 52.14 billion tons of CO2 emissions in six
   high-energy intensive industries, was the leading force explaining CO2
   emissions change; and the effect of which was most significant in power
   industry (20.52 billion tons of CO2 emissions increase). Energy
   intensity was the major contributor to promote the decline in CO2
   emissions, and the effect was most significant in chemical industry and
   non-metallic mineral products industry. Besides, energy structure and
   industrial structure effects have relatively small impacts on CO2
   emissions change due to the relatively stable energy structure and
   industrial structure during the study period. Policy recommendations are
   made for future emission reductions in Chinese six high-energy intensive
   industries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries-an evaluation of the
   Swedish voluntary agreement PFE},
Journal = {ENERGY EFFICIENCY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {225-241},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the Swedish Programme for improving energy
   efficiency in energy-intensive industries (PFE). Since 2005, some 100
   energy-intensive companies have entered this 5-year voluntary agreement
   (VA) and been exempted from the EU minimum tax on electricity. In
   return, each company is required to: conduct an energy audit and
   analysis; identify and invest in profitable electricity saving measures;
   implement and certify an energy management system; introduce routines
   for energy efficient procurement and project planning. For most
   participants the first programme period was completed in 2009 and
   available data enables this PFE ex-post evaluation. An impact evaluation
   compiles and analyse data that the companies have reported to the
   administrating agency, the Swedish Energy Agency (SEA). This assessment
   of quantifiable results is complemented by a process-oriented approach
   that combines studies of policy documents, previous evaluations and
   personal communication with administrators as well as companies. The
   bottom-up calculation method distinguishes between gross and net impact.
   While the SEA estimates a gross impact of 1,450 GW h/year, the net
   impact consists of an interval between 689 and 1,015 GW h of net annual
   electricity savings. PFE has effectively and, to a low cost, exceeded
   the estimated impact of a minimum tax and can thus be judged as
   successful. A comprehensive evaluation plan could facilitate relevant
   data gathering in PFE and similar VAs and could, in doing so, improve
   accuracy and possibly reduce evaluation cost. Such a plan should give
   weight also to the organisational changes, with potential long-lasting
   effects, that these programmes are capable of promoting.},

Title = {Drivers and Barriers for Efficient Energy Management Practices in
   Energy-Intensive Industries: A Case-Study of Iron and Steel Sector},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The two major reasons behind the world's energy crisis are losses in
   energy transmission and less efficient energy use at sinks. The former
   flaw can be catered by changing the entire energy transmission system
   which requires investment and planning on a large scale, whereas the
   later deficiency can be overcome through proper management of energy
   utilizing systems. Energy-intensive industries have a substantial share
   in energy consumption and equally high energy saving potentials if they
   adopt some integrated and improved energy efficiency. This study
   investigates the energy management systems in the iron and steel sector
   of Pakistan, and compare it with findings of similar work in Sweden,
   Bangladesh, and Ghana. A systematic questionnaire was circulated in the
   iron and steel sector across the country and afterward the collected
   data was analyzed to find major barriers and drivers for efficient
   energy management practices. In addition, questions on non-energy
   benefits and information sources relevant to the energy efficiency were
   also part of the questionnaire. Cost reduction resulting from lowered
   energy use was rated as the most important driver for applying
   energy-efficient operation. On the other hand, the cost of production
   disruption was considered among high-level barriers to the
   implementation of improved energy efficiency. An increase in the
   life-time of equipment was labeled as the top non-energy benefits.
   Company peers and seminars/conferences were referred as the best
   information sources related to energy efficiency. The outcome of the
   study will be helpful to the decision-maker in the industry, as well as
   the government levels.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {2618-2624},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Improvement of coal consumption efficiency is very important both for
   China in solving its problems of energy security and environmental
   pollution and for the world in addressing the issue of greenhouse gas
   emissions. Using a total-factor framework, this paper employs a data
   envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to evaluate the coal consumption
   efficiency of six energy intensive sub-industries in China in 2015. Coal
   consumption efficiency is factorized into economic efficiency and
   environmental efficiency, with sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and
   industrial smoke, dust and soot emissions treated as undesirable outputs
   of energy consumptions. The results show the following. (1) Of the six
   energy intensive subindustries studied, two exhibit both DEA-effective
   coal economic efficiency and coal environmental efficiency. Coal
   economic efficiency is found to be greater than coal environmental
   efficiency, indicating that the benefits of economic efficiency have
   masked the negative effects of the environmental impact. China should
   therefore pay more attention to the clean utilization of coal. (2) Low
   environmental efficiency mainly resulted from the joint effects of pure
   technical efficiency and scale efficiency; therefore, enterprises in
   these industries must engage in management efforts to improve their
   ability to manage large enterprises. (3) The energy intensive industries
   characterized by coal environmental efficiency that failed to achieve
   pure technological effectiveness all exhibited input redundancy or
   output inadequacy of varying degrees while showing a potential for
   energy conservation and emissions reductions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {We define a purely hydroelectric power system as a power system
   consisting almost entirely of hydroelectric generating stations, where
   themal backup stations are used only intermittently in dry periods. The
   expansion process for such a system consists of selecting from a set of
   available projects with certain investment cost and generating capacity
   charateristics. One of these charateristics is a measure of the
   Economies of Scale (EOS). In this paper the EOS for hydroelectric
   projects are investigated by using available cost and capacity data from
   the Icelandic power system. Furthermore the tradeoff between large and
   small projects is investigated by weighting the lost sales during the
   period of excess capacity against the benefit of using larger projects
   due to the EOS. The optimum is shown graphically and depends on the
   demand growth and interest rate. We investigate a hypothetical example
   where a series of generating facilities can be replicated at will to
   satisfy a linear general demand. These results are then expanded by
   assuming a stepwise demand associated with each project to satisfy bulk
   energy demand such as that of Energy Intensive Industry (EII). The
   results are illustrated graphically in a case study using data from the
   ``purely hydroelectric{''} Icelandic power system.},

Abstract = {Electricity cost constitutes an important part of the total energy cost
   for some energy-intensive industries (EIIs). For enterprises belonging
   to such EIIs, an effective way to reduce the electricity cost is to
   integrate the renewable energy such as wind and/or photovoltaic energy
   into their energy systems. In this paper, the problem of generation
   scheduling of self-generation power plant (SGPP) in EII microgrid with
   wind power is considered. First, a robust optimization-based formulation
   with flexible uncertainty set is established to obtain the feasible
   range of SGPP outputs, which can ensure the robustness and
   nonanticipativity of the system. Second, the economic dispatch (ED)
   model based on the feasible range is proposed and the multi-period
   scheduling problem is decoupled into a series of single-period ED
   problems. Besides, the analytical solution to the ED problem is given
   and thus the computational efficiency is guaranteed. Numerical testing
   is performed for a real system and the results show that the method is

Abstract = {This study addresses the planning and implementation of energy,
   industry, and carbon economy policies concerning the development of the
   Taiwan's energy intensive industries from perspective of climate change.
   As a newly industrialized country, Taiwan attaches greater importance to
   the development of green energy and low-carbon industries, in
   cooperation with global pressure for carbon reduction due to climate
   changes, through energy and industrial conferences. Thus, in the past
   year the Taiwanese government constructed four laws concerning energy
   and carbon reduction in order to drive the green energy industry;
   furthermore, it plans to reduce current carbon emission benchmarks.
   Nevertheless, statistical analysis found that in the last decade, energy
   intensive industries have presented structural unbalance regarding
   energy consumption, CO2 emissions, energy intensity, contributions to
   the GDP, and product value. Industries in the industrial sector have
   high energy consumption, high carbon emissions, and increase total
   domestic consumption and carbon emissions, which have disproportionate
   contributions to industrial added value: nevertheless, the government
   continues to approve investments for such energy intensive industries,
   and results in continuous increases in energy consumption and carbon
   emissions. This contradictory phenomenon indicates that newly
   industrialized countries rely on a manufacturing economic structure,
   which is difficult to adjust and violates the trends of a global
   low-carbon economy. Hence, the government must examine and adjust such
   unbalanced industrial structures, where such adjustments are executed in
   a fair and just manner, and encourage the development of high
   value-added measures for low-carbon manufacturing and service sectors to
   become equal with competitors in a global economy. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {The need for competitiveness on the global market is the main driver for
   industrial companies to systematically and continuously analyse all
   possibilities for the optimisation of production process and related
   costs reduction. Modern industrial processes are increasingly complex
   with highly dynamic energy use patterns. A systematic approach to
   industrial energy system analysis requires proper understanding of
   interactions among the main factors influencing energy performance.
   Also, systematic approach takes into consideration not only efficiency
   of individual equipment or machines but also their performances within a
   system where each piece of equipment delivers specific function.
   This paper presents a context sensitive production planning and energy
   management approach for achieving energy savings and emissions reduction
   in energy intensive industry. Combination of decision support for
   production planning and simulation of possible future situations with
   context sensitive monitoring and targeting are vital elements of
   proposed approach and are necessary for continuous improvement of energy
   performance. The proposed approach includes four building blocks: (1)
   ambient intelligent data acquisition and context processing, (2) energy
   modelling and emissions calculation including the prediction engine, (3)
   decision support services and the (4) knowledge repository. The proposed
   approach has been tested in the real industrial environment and initial
   testing results are indicating the potential of the proposed approach to
   initiate sustainable changes in the production process. Also, external
   factors that are beyond control but which do influence daily operations
   of energy intensive industrial companies have been analysed, for example
   process operators' behaviour and variations in production outputs. (C)

Abstract = {In recent years significant research efforts have been related with the
   energy efficiency in energy intensive industries. It is promising that
   EU has already demonstrated how much can be done in reducing the energy
   intensity of manufacturing processes through energy efficiency and
   sustainable production processes. The overall objective of any energy
   efficiency related program or project in industry is reduction of costs,
   energy consumption, environmental impacts and raw material use. The
   research work presented in this paper is related to long term production
   planning and decision support system based on the artificial neural
   network net fitting model. To tackle these challenges a system for
   simulation and analysis of future situations relevant for production
   planning in energy intensive industries has been developed. It enables
   optimal response on excessive energy consumption and costs in relation
   to fuel changes and environmental impacts. The results presented in this
   paper confirm that the addressed system has the potential to be applied
   in energy intensive industries, taking into account plant specific input
   parameters and context variables.},

Abstract = {Crop residues have been undervalued as a source of renewable energy to
   displace coal in the national energy mix for greenhouse emission
   reduction in Malawi. Switching to crop residues as an alternative energy
   source for energy-intensive industries such as cement manufacturing is
   hampered by uncertainties in crop residue availability, cost and
   quality. In this study, future demand for energy and availability of
   crop residues was assessed, based on data at the sub-national level.
   Detailed energy potentials from crop residues were computed for eight
   agricultural divisions. The results showed that the projected total
   energy demands in 2020, 2025 and 2030 were approximately 177 810 TJ, 184
   210 TJ and 194 096 TJ respectively. The highest supply potentials were
   found to be in the central and southern regions of Malawi, coinciding
   with the locations of the two clinker plants. Crop residues could meet
   45-57\% of the national total energy demand. The demand from the cement
   industry is only 0.8\% of the estimated biomass energy potential. At an
   annual production of 600 000 t of clinker and 20\% biomass co firing
   with coal, 18 562 t of coal consumption would be avoided and 46 128 t of
   carbon dioxide emission reduction achieved per year. For sustainability,
   holistic planning and implementation would be necessary to ensure the
   needs of various users of crop residues are met. Furthermore, there
   would be a need to address social, economic and environmental barriers
   of the crop residue-based biomass energy supply chain. Future research
   should focus on local residue-to-product ratios and their calorific
   values.},

Abstract = {The innovation effect is an important component when measuring the
   performance of environmental policy instruments. Based on a
   questionnaire survey, this research has examined corporate energy
   conservation and emission reduction efforts in energy intensive
   industries in China under the pressure of different climate policies,
   and in particular looked into their adoption of those technological
   innovation and diffusion activities. The results show a large variety of
   corporate adoption of energy-saving practical activities. In general,
   climate policies have played a greater role in promoting the adoption of
   managerial energy-saving activities in respondent companies, while
   comparatively their influences on the adoption of technology upgrading
   activities are relatively weak. Regulatory measures have exerted greater
   pressure and influence on corporate short-term behavioural change, as
   stated by the respondent companies. However, market based instruments
   show greater incentive effect in promoting adoption of energy
   conservation and emission reduction activities that refer to corporate
   long-term oriented strategic planning or adjustment. For instance they
   exert a significant incentive effect on increasing long-term research
   and development investment for technological innovation, and also play
   an important role in optimising corporate organisational structure. The
   econometric analysis further proves the influences of market based
   instruments in promoting corporate adoption of technological innovation

   of waste reuse},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {200-207},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cement is the main component of concrete, which is, in turn, the second
   most consumed material on earth, in addition, the cement industry is one
   of the most intensive energy consumptions. The modern plants often have
   nominal production capacity exceeding one million tons per year. To
   produce one ton of cement, you need the equivalent of 60-130 kg of fuel
   and 110 kWh of electricity. Due to the large consumption of energy,
   which represents over 30\% of the total production cost for the cement
   industry, the reduction in spending on energy inputs is a major
   motivation for technological advances in the production process of
   cement. To reduce the costs of fossil fuel consumption (non-renewable
   source), the technique of co-processing has been employed for
   introducing alternative fuels as part of the manufacturing process. This
   technique provides a lower cost of production, introducing fuel waste
   from different industrial activities, besides contributing to the
   reduction of environmental liabilities; they generate waste when
   discarded in inappropriate places. It is evident that the cement
   industry sector is highly intensive in energy consumption, and should be
   considered in studies on energy planning, especially with the changes in
   its energy matrix, which has occurred continuously since the oil crisis
   in 70 years, still that this change is very heterogeneous when one
   considers each manufactures cement. The ecological analysis is done
   through comparison between ecological efficiency, pollution indicator
   and values for CO2 equivalent from cement industry rate, before and
   after adoption of waste reuse. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {208-215},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {A cost-effective and robust waste treatment and recycling system is a
   requisite of a sustainable society. In our previous study, we proposed a
   ``smart recycling system{''} that utilizes existing industrial
   facilities with higher energy efficiency so that a cost-effective and
   robust recycling system for treating municipal wastes can be
   established. In this study, we further develop the concept of smart
   recycling and propose a framework for facilitating the implementation of
   such a system. By making use of existing facilities and adopting both
   closed-loop and semi-closed-loop recycling processes, this system allows
   flexible adaptations on the changes of external factors. A spatially
   optimal scale is necessary to meet the requirements for such a smart
   recycling system. Thus, we develop an integrated model that combines
   both geographical information system based collection model and a
   process model for a smart recycling center. In order to test its
   applicability, we employ a case study approach to simulate the
   implementation of smart recycling in the three satellite cities of Tokyo
   Metropolitan Area and evaluate its effects under three different
   scenarios. Our simulation results show that smart recycling cannot only
   reduce carbon dioxide emission but also lower the overall costs. Also,
   by comparing with conventional waste incineration, we find that the unit
   cost of smart recycling is relatively stable to changes of the waste
   amounts due to its lower fixed costs for facilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {On the progress in flexibility and grid charges in light of the energy
   transition: The case of Germany},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {165},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the course of the energy transition, flexibility on the demand side
   is crucial to balance intermittent supply from renewable energy sources.
   In Germany, however, a large part of the demand side flexibility
   potential remains unused, especially due to an outdated and
   inappropriate grid charges regulation. In this respect, policymakers
   have failed to align their regulatory instruments, e.g., grid charges,
   to the flexibility requirements of the energy transition. Moreover,
   regulatory and planning uncertainties regarding the long-term vision for
   future electricity systems inhibit flexibility investments - marking
   another policy failure. Although the above issues are known to
   policymakers for quite some time, too little has been done to further
   develop corresponding regulation. This policy inaction results from a
   decision-making dilemma, in which policymakers did not reach a solution
   that benefits all stakeholders involved in the grid charges debate
   (e.g., energy-intensive and less energy-intensive electricity
   consumers). Solving the policy failure in the form of a revised and
   future-proof grid charges regulation will, however, increase the
   prospect of a just outcome for society and, more specifically,
   recognition and cosmopolitan justice. In this paper, we outline how grid
   charges inhibit demand side flexibility in Germany and which policy
   failures have ultimately contributed to stuck political decision-making.
   We further provide concrete suggestions of how existing policy failures
   may be corrected in order to ensure a successful energy transition as a
   policy guide for Germany and other countries all around the world.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, the Icelandic, island, hydro-based power system has been
   scheduled and planned based on local, isolated demand of two types:
   General Demand (GD) and the flat, now dominating Energy Intensive
   Industry (EII) demand. Thus a local load profile determines the
   scheduled operation, perhaps causing underutilization of resources, and
   water spillage. This limited flexibility is built into an isolated
   system, but interruptible EII contracts have served to increase the
   utilization to better meet the variable resource inflow (Water,
   geothermal steam). However, an access to a larger market would mitigate
   and change radically this limitation. Therefore a model based estimate
   of possible benefits is all important, when considering a UK-Iceland
   HVDC submarine link.
   This paper compares the optimal scheduling of a test system based on the
   Iceland system, with and without an external submarine link to a larger
   electricity market. A model HYDW1 uses linear programming (LP) and CPLEX
   to simulate weekly operations, using an official long term load
   forecast. This test system uses historical weekly averaged UK
   electricity spot prices and assumes a submarine link with preliminary
   cost estimates.
   The results quantify the benefits of trading flexible water power in a
   spot market, in terms of energy sales and operations costs by better
   utilizing the installed capacity, water flow and reservoirs. Finally,
   conclusions are drawn on expanding the weekly HYDW1 model to encompass a
   short term extension to enhance the future planning framework.},

   Signaling in Klebsiella pneumoniae},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {Biofilm formation by Klebsiella pneumoniae on indwelling medical devices
   increases the risk of infection. Both type 1 and type 3 fimbriae are
   important factors in biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae. We found that a
   putative enzyme II (EII) complex of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):
   carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS), etcA (EIIA)-etcB
   (EIIB)-etcC (EIIC), regulated biofilm and type 3 fimbriae formation by
   K. pneumoniae STU1. In this study, the regulatory mechanism of etcABC in
   K. pneumoniae type 3 fimbriae formation was investigated. We found via
   quantitative RTPCR that overexpression of etcABC enhanced the
   transcription level of the mrk operon, which is involved in type 3
   fimbriae synthesis, and reduced the transcription level of the fim
   operon, which is involved in type 1 fimbriae synthesis. To gain further
   insight into the role of etcABC in type 3 fimbriae synthesis, we
   analyzed the region upstream of the mrk operon and found the potential
   cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP)
   binding site. After crp was deleted in K. pneumoniae STU1 and two
   clinical isolates, these three crp mutant strains could not express
   MrkA, the major subunit of the fimbrial shaft, indicating that CRP
   positively regulated type 3 fimbriae synthesis. Moreover, a crp mutant
   overexpressing etcABC could not express MrkA, indicating that the
   regulation of type 3 fimbriae by etcABC was dependent on CRP. In
   addition, deletion of cyaA, which encodes the adenylyl cyclase that
   synthesizes cAMP, and deletion of crr, which encodes the
   glucose-specific EIIA, led to a reduction in lac operon regulation and
   therefore bacterial lactose uptake in K. pneumoniae. Exogenous cAMP but
   not etcABC overexpression compensated for the role of cyaA in bacterial
   lactose uptake. However, either etcABC overexpression or exogenous cAMP
   compensated for the role of crr in bacterial lac operon regulation that
   would eventually restore lactose uptake. We also found via ELISA and the
   luxCDABE reporter system that overexpression of etcABC increased
   intracellular cAMP levels and the transcription level of crp,
   respectively, in K. pneumoniae. In conclusion, overexpression of etcABC
   positively regulated cAMP production and cAMP-CRP activity to activate
   the mrk operon, resulting in increased type 3 fimbriae synthesis in K.

Abstract = {Iceland has considerable resources in wind energy, with the relatively
   high winds in this island climate. However, wind generation is, as
   always, intermittent and needs backup to match demand profiles.
   This paper studies wind energy profiles and wind integration in the
   hydropower and geothermal dominated power system of Iceland. The purpose
   is to map out potential wind parks and their integration using a hydro
   scheduling operations model. First, the properties of the measured wind
   speed series are studied, using standard conversion characteristics, and
   then potential wind parks are postulated and integrated into the
   electricity generation.
   In many respects the Icelandic system is a perfect match for wind
   generation. It has large hydro energy storage in reservoirs which can be
   used as backup generation, when the wind is not blowing. The interaction
   of wind and hydro calls for studying the load serving capability of the
   wind generation. This leads to calculating a capacity metric for the
   wind parks. Another issue of interest is the need for expanded hydro
   capacity and increased size of reservoirs. This may also depend on the
   wind park size and penetration of the wind resources.
   These issues are of particular interest considering the current mix of
   energy intensive industry (EII) with local load and possible future
   export and direct sales in a larger electricity spot market.},

Abstract = {A range of EU environmental policies support the goal of reducing
   fossil-fuel use in commercial thermal applications. Combustion
   installations which are covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme now
   face a substantial opportunity cost for fossil-fuel CO2 emissions.
   However, it is unclear whether the EU ETS will provide a sufficient
   incentive for switching to forest-derived biomass fuel by
   energy-intensive installations currently firing on coal or peat. Using
   Ireland as a case study, the paper analyses the availability and cost
   competitiveness of forest residues produced within the vicinity of three
   cement kilns. EU Allowance prices observed during much of 2007 and 2008
   would appear to be sufficient to equalise the carbon-adjusted purchase
   costs between chipped pulpwood and bituminous coal. However, no such
   fuel switching has been observed to date by kiln operators and none
   appears to be envisaged. The apparent reasons for this include (1) a
   ready availability of cheaper substitute fuels such as Meat and Bone
   Meal; (2) technical issues regarding the chemical consistency of the
   woodchip; and (3) the prospect of pulpwood prices rising in the medium
   term due a growing supply shortage. The prospect of such a constraint is
   an unintended consequence of Irish government policy to promote biomass
   co-firing in peat-fired power stations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Urban population has been increasing at an unprecedented rate
   accommodating more than half of the world population in cities. Massive
   human intervention in the tropical region contributes to loss of
   environmental integrity amplifying challenges like air pollution,
   deforestation, water scarcity, local extinction, and destruction of
   natural landscapes. To shape the international community's attitude
   toward economic, social, and environmental development regarding
   environmental integrity different methods- Reducing Emissions from
   Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), Clean Development
   Mechanism (CMD)-are introduced. However, these methods have some
   limitations along with opportunities. This paper reviewed and analyzed
   existing methods in order to promote environmental integrity in the
   rapidly growing urban settings. Based on the drawbacks of current
   methods a new Environmental Integrity Index (Ell) is proposed where
   indicators are selected while considering social, economic, and
   environmental aspects. The index aims to combine data from field
   surveys, GIS and remote sensing, and economic and social analysis. We
   anticipate that this proposed index can support planning for sustainable
   cities by promoting environmental integrity and balancing biological and

   operation strategies for hydro system and the planning and operations
   tools needed to realize this rent.
   Planning tools and modeling for hydro dominated systems may in some
   respects inherently be more complex than those of thermally dominated
   systems, due to the time-interdependence associated with reservoir
   storage and various constraints {[}4]. In this paper we give an overview
   of historical and current modeling practices used both as a tool to form
   system expansion policies and operations strategies in the long, medium
   and short term. The basic time frame requirements for such tools are
   discussed in this paper and how the may evolve in the future in terms of
   methodology and other important issues. Conclusions will be drawn
   regarding these planning tools and the future planning and operations
   framework in such a system, especialy the time frame issue.
   The long and medium term hydro-scheduling problem has been investigated
   since in the early part of the 20th century {[}14], applying various
   optimization and iterative simulation methodologies. The practices
   applied in the Icelandic system have traditionally been based on
   Scandinavian approaches, such as those originally suggested by {[}9],
   {[}17] and {[}2]. These methods in hydro dominated systems have been
   based on an iterative calculation of water value tables based on
   iterative dynamic programming like algorithms. Future methodology may
   involve LP or SDDP {[}16], but with a short term considerations (DTM,
   see below) to certain extent as outlined in this paper.},

   small and medium enterprises (SME) and energy intensive industry. These
   CAES are equipped with air storage. This paper analyzes how those
   systems may provide flexibility for electrical Demand Response (DR) in
   city districts. The paper presents first, the modeling of a CAES system.
   The system design, such as compressor and storage size is then performed
   based on the modeling results. The mixed-integer linear optimization
   model for using CAES is explained afterwards. The optimization is an
   offline day-ahead optimization for planning operation purposes. The
   approach is analyzed in terms of flexibility within a test case for
   optimizing the CAES of a typical German car repair shop.},

Abstract = {Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording is vital for brain
   science research, monitoring pathological and physiological conditions,
   and the diagnosis of brain disease. Conventional wet electrodes require
   skin preparation and a gel electrolyte to reduce electrode-skin
   interface impedance (EII), which limits its further application in
   long-term EEG signal recording. Microneedle-array electrodes (MAEs) have
   been employed in EEG recording, as they can be used directly without
   skin preparation or the gel electrolyte. However, most microneedles used
   in MAE are rigid and have a high aspect ratio; thus, they can break
   easily. Hence, we developed a novel bendable MAE for EEG recording. It
   is made of a flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillar array with
   rigid microneedle tips. The PDMS pillar array could help the MAE pass
   through hair and enable the microneedle tips to penetrate a stratum
   corneum layer into a scalp, thus reducing the EII. Moreover, the PDMS
   pillar array is bendable, which prevents the microneedles tips from
   breaking. The MAE can record EEG signals well in a BIOPAC system and an
   Emotiv EPOC+ device. The bendable MAE may be an alternative electrode
   for long-term EEG recording.},

   a company can lower its overall energy costs through improved planning

Abstract = {In traditional power systems production always followed consumption,
   while nowadays consumers are incentivized to take active part in
   electricity markets. In energy intensive industry large portion of the
   product cost goes to energy expenses. Thus, optimizing operations based
   on market signals can create substantial benefits for industrial
   prosumers. Industries with more than one energy input vector, e.g.
   electricity and gas, both being bought from their respective day ahead
   markets are investigated in this paper. The paper introduces enthalpy
   modeling versus conventional mass flow which increases the scheduling
   efficiency. Proposed optimization model is based on stochastic mixed
   integer linear programming where prices of electricity are treated as
   stochastic process as oppose to deterministic approach usually used.
   Goal of optimization is to reduce overall energy cost. Also, it must
   provide bidding strategy for both day-ahead markets. Idea is to reduce
   market variability by proper device scheduling, utilizing flexibility
   between energy vectors and behind the meter production of electricity.},

Abstract = {China's fossil fuel electric power industry, a traditionally energy-
   intensive industry, is the focus of recent environmental regulation. In
   this paper, we propose a framework to measure the effect of
   environmental regulation on power plants. First, we use the
   non-parametric distance function to construct the regulatory stringency
   index with DEA for specific fossil fuel electric power plants. Second,
   we incorporate the proposed regulatory stringency index into the
   restricted cost function, to estimate the environmental regulation
   effect on power plants, including the effect on productivity and
   elasticities of substitution. This approach allows us to overcome the
   problem of the data unavailability. Results indicate that there is an
   approximate U-shaped effect of environmental regulation on productivity
   growth. Productivity growth is mainly driven by technological progress.
   The substitution possibility between capital and energy is a good sign
   for Porter hypothesis in China. These findings provide policy
   implications for power plants to carry out environmental regulation and

Abstract = {The electronics industry plays an essential role in the future of a
   Taiwan economy based on science, technology, and innovation. At the same
   time, it is also the most energy-intensive industry. Taiwan is currently
   driven by high-carbon power generation, and adopts a passive carbon
   reduction pathway, but unless Taiwan urgently undergoes energy
   transition, the development of Taiwan's electronics industry will be
   impeded. Our analysis found that the petrochemical and electronics
   industries are the main sources of carbon emissions (27.1\%) and
   electricity consumption (31.6\%) in Taiwan, and the existence of the
   petrochemical industry has constrained the growth of the electronics
   industry, which has therefore resulted in conundrums to Taiwan's
   sustainability strategy. To accommodate the growth of the electronics
   industry, Taiwan needs to undertake three major transitions: energy
   transition, industrial transition, and restrain the growth of energy
   (energy conservation). Under the policy of the nuclear-free homeland,
   the reduction of coal-fired and thermal power generation, while at the
   same time increasing the share of renewable energy in power generation,
   are urgent and important government projects in Taiwan; however, the

Abstract = {As an energy-intensive industry, the mining, smelting, processing and
   production of metallic mineral resources consumes a large amount of
   fossil energy and simultaneously emits high amounts of carbon dioxide.
   This paper discusses the decoupling relationship between the economy and
   CO2 emissions of China's metal industry (MI) and then adopts an
   integrated decomposition approach (which reveals the roles of technology
   and efficiency) to investigate the drivers of CO2 emissions. The main
   findings indicate that, during 2000-2016: (1) China's MI experienced
   four decoupling stages (i.e., weak decoupling, expansive negative
   decoupling, expansive coupling, and strong decoupling) and was
   characterized by weak decoupling. Overall, China's MI showed a clear
   tendency toward strong decoupling. (2) Potential energy intensity
   change, investment efficiency decline, and production technological
   progress were three pivotal factors contributing to emission abatement.
   Industrial structure regulation and energy-saving technology advancement
   also made a small contribution to emission abatement and the decoupling
   state. (3) Investment scale expansion was the primary factor promoting
   emission growth and impeding the progress of decoupling. Meanwhile, the
   energy structure adjustment during the sampling period failed to inhibit
   emissions but restricted decoupling. Finally, possible policies for
   mitigating carbon emissions in China's MI are provided. (c) 2019

Abstract = {The production of primary aluminum is an energy-intensive industry which
   produces large amounts of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions,

   Energy Planning proved to be an efficient tool for reducing
   energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. This study focuses on energy
   planning constrained by CO2 emissions and determines the required amount
   of CO2 emissions from electricity sources in order to meet specified CO2
   emission benchmark. The study is demonstrated on and applied to specific
   aluminum products, aluminum slugs and aluminum evaporator panels. Three
   different approaches of energy planning are considered: (i) an
   insight-based, graphical targeting approach, (ii) an algebraic targeting
   approach of cascade analysis, and (iii) an optimization-based approach,
   using a transportation model. The results of the three approaches show
   that approximately 2.15 MWh of fossil energy source should be replaced
   with a zero-carbon or 2.22 MWh with a low-carbon energy source to
   satisfy the benchmark of CO2 emissions to produce 1 t of aluminum slug;
   however, this substitution results in higher costs. This study is the
   first of its kind demonstrated on and applied to specific aluminum
   products, and represents a step forward in the development of more

Abstract = {In this study, a long-range energy alternative planning (LEAP) model was

   results indicate that the policy of shifting economic activity from the
   EIMS to other sectors is most helpful for China to achieve its targets
   of mitigating CO2 emissions and conserving energy. Encouraging the EIMS
   to use more electricity can help China to achieve a higher proportion of
   non-fossil-fuel based energy in its overall primary energy consumption.
   No single policy will allow China to achieve all the targets,

Abstract = {Energy, water, and the environment are intricately connected, and these
   relationships necessitate their simultaneous management to achieve
   sustainable development. In this study, a stochastic multidivisional
   hierarchy model (SMHM) is developed for use in planning an
   energy-water-environment nexus system (EWES). The SMHM is not only
   capable of addressing uncertainties expressed as interval and stochastic
   parameters within multidivisional and multi-level contexts, but also
   those accounting for the synergy and trade-off relationships between
   different stakeholders. Decisions are made through the SMHM in two
   stages: top management given the first choice followed by the concurrent
   responses of the divisions. SMHM is applied to a real-world case study
   of EWES in Shanxi, China. Results reveal that energy-intensive industry
   (i.e., electricity generation) consumes more water and emits more
   pollutants than others. In addition, uncertainties have significant
   effects on the planning strategies of EWES; compared with a high-risk
   scenario of electricity insufficiency, a low-risk scenario would consume
   additional amounts of {[}3.3, 5.7] x 10(9) tce energy and {[}1.8, 2.6] x
   10(6) m(3) water. Compared with single-level models, the SMHM schemes
   enable both resource savings and environmental sustainability. These
   findings could assist stakeholders in resolving conflicts and provide
   useful information for the integrated management of regional energy,
   water, and the environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A multi-criteria decision support model for adopting energy efficiency
   technologies in the iron and steel industry},
Journal = {ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Promoting energy efficiency in iron and steel production provides
   opportunities for mitigating environmental impacts from this
   energy-intensive industry. Energy efficiency technologies differ in
   investment costs, fuel-saving potentials, and environmental performance.
   Hence the decision-making of the adoption strategy needs to prioritize
   technological combinations concerning these multi-dimensional
   objectives. To address this problem, this study proposes a hybrid
   multi-criteria decision-support model for adopting energy efficiency
   technologies in the iron and steel industry. The modeling framework
   integrates a linear programming model that determines the optimal
   technology adoption rates based on the techno-economic, energy, and
   environmental performance details and an interactive multi-criteria
   model analysis tool for diverse modeling environments. A real case study
   was performed in which a total number of 56 energy efficiency
   technologies were investigated against various criteria concerning
   economics, energy, and environmental performances. The results examine
   the tradeoffs and synergies were examined with regard to seven criteria.
   A balanced solution shows that a total investment of 13.4 billion USD
   could save 2.51 Exajoule fuel consumption, cut 67.4 million tons (Mton)
   CO2 emissions, and reduce air pollution of 1.5 Mton SO2, 1.41 Mton NOx,
   and 0.86 Mton PM, respectively. The case study demonstrates the
   effectiveness and applicability of the proposed multi-criteria
   decision-making support framework.},

Abstract = {As Parties to the Climate Convention EU Member States have opted for a
   joint fulfilment of post-2000 greenhouse gas emission reduction
   obligations. No agreement could be reached on a joint EU target before
   the distribution of the burden of emission reductions among Member
   States had been agreed upon, This paper presents a sectoral approach to
   burden sharing, which incorporates important national circumstances. The
   three categories distinguished are the power sector, the internationally
   operating energy-intensive industry and the remaining domestically
   oriented sectors. Emission allowances are calculated by applying rules,
   such as a limitation of coal use for power production, minimum
   requirements for renewable energy, and minimum energy efficiency
   improvement rates in industry. For the domestic sectors a per capita
   emission allowance approach is used, The approach is applied to EU
   Member States to show the distribution of emission reductions for 2010.
   Also a comparison with other burden differentiation approaches is made,
   Results of the analysis played an important role in internal EU
   discussions, resulting in a better understanding among negotiators of
   differences in national circumstances and their role in emission levels,
   This improved understanding led to a political agreement on emission
   reduction targets that are substantially higher than targets Member
   States had been prepared to accept earlier. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {To promote energy conservation and emission reduction, China recently
   implemented a tradable green certificate market on the basis of the
   carbon emissions trading market. As an energy-intensive industry, the
   power industry is one of the leading contributors to carbon emissions in
   China. It is also the main participant in both the tradable green
   certificate market and the carbon emissions trading market. How to deal
   with the integration impact of the green certificate market and the
   carbon emissions trading market becomes a great challenge for the
   Chinese power industry. To improve sustainable development of Chinese
   power industry considering the integration impact of the green
   certificate market and the carbon emissions trading market, we
   established a simulation model based on system dynamics theory and
   scenario design method. The results of the study show that: (1) the
   implementation of tradable green certificate and carbon emissions
   trading mechanisms helps to control carbon emissions of the power
   industry, and to promote national targets of carbon emission reduction
   in China, (2) the optimization of electric power structure is positively
   related with renewable portfolio standard, and (3) the increase in the
   investment of renewable energy power generation technology not only
   brings large profit margins to power companies but also promote the
   achievement of sustainable development goals at the national level. (C)

Abstract = {The Icelandic power system, is currently based entirely on renewable
   energy from hydro and geothermal generators. In addition, wind resources
   are being developed. In the past the systems has served local demands of
   two types: (a) Variable General Demand (VGD) and (b) the dominating and
   constant Energy Intensive Industry Demand (EIID). The VGD load is
   variable by the hour but the EIID is constant. Both loads must be served
   at all times to satisfy bilateral contracts in the absence of a local
   electricity spot market. In this paper, we examine the possibility of
   trading in the United Kingdom (U.K.) spot market through a submarine
   HVDC interconnector (IC). The benefits are estimated using a two stage
   scheduling model, HYDW2 (HYDro and Wind scheduling model 2) with two
   stages: (1) weekly and (2) hourly. The HYDW2 uses Linear Programming
   (LP). It is applied to a specific test case based on the Icelandic
   system, but with new hydro and wind generators. The key interaction of
   wind with hydro reservoirs and the spot market is of particular
   interest. The input data include historical spot prices, local loads,
   primary energy inflow, IC constraints and other system attributes. The
   potential benefits include less spilled water and idle hydro capacity,
   higher income, resource rent and improved supply security and the
   possible significant reduction in Greenhouse gas emissions.},

Abstract = {The level of personality functioning, relevant for treatment planning,
   can be evaluated by the Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS) Ego
   Impairment Index-2 (EII-2) and by interview assessment of the severity
   of personality pathology. However, few studies on the association
   between these assessment methods have been reported. This study examines
   the strength of association between the EII-2 and its subcomponents with
   the interview-based Level of Personality Organization (LPO) assessment
   scale, and investigates their mutual associations with psychiatric
   symptoms, diagnoses, and history. Altogether, 315 mood or anxiety
   disorder outpatients without severe personality pathology were assessed
   with the LPO and tested with the CS, on which the EII-2 and its
   subcomponents (FQ-, WSum6, Critical contents, M-, PHR, GHR, and R) were
   calculated. Significant, but weak association between the EII-2 and the
   LPO was found. The WSum6, a measure of thought disorder, was the only
   EII-2 subcomponent significantly associated with the LPO. Both measures
   were consistently associated with psychiatric symptoms, diagnoses and
   history. The findings partially support the EII-2 and the LPO as
   consistently associated, relatively independent measures of the severity
   of personality pathology. More research on the incremental benefits of
   the measures is needed in clinical populations, covering non-severe and
   complex psychopathology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {The influence of local government decision-making competition on
   enterprise innovation investment under information asymmetry and
   multiple risk appetite type},
Journal = {KYBERNETES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},

Pages = {802-817},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to analyze the impact of the degree of local
   government decision-making competition on the optimal investment amount,
   investment location and investment failure of innovative investment
   enterprise under multiple risk appetite type of innovative investment
   enterprise. This paper also points out three regulation paths that
   central government could use to avoid the influence of local government
   decision-making competition on the validity of enterprise innovation
   investment (EII).
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on analysis frame of government
   competition about unitary government states, this paper builds duopoly
   decision model to analyze influence of local government decision-making
   competition on EII. Considering information asymmetry and multiple risk
   appetite type of decision-maker, this paper analyzes influence of local
   government decision-making competition on location selection, the
   optimal investment amount, identification of investment failure and exit
   mechanism of EII according to different relationship between reference
   points of local government decision-making competition and EII.
   Finding - The optimal investment amount of EII has positive correlation
   with risk appetite type of decision-maker, local government
   decision-making competition. Identification of investment failure and
   exit are divided into three phases. The boundary conditions are directly
   related to risk appetite type and amount of local government subsidy.
   Regional factor endowment and degree of preferential policy are main
   factors attracting enterprise investment. Local governments should
   analyze the interests of EII. There are three paths to avoid vicious
   competition among local governments: unified planning, revising of audit
   index, increasing penalties for failure of policies.
   Originality/value - With rapid development of China's new urbanization
   process, urban economy has become an important carrier of economic
   development. Attracting foreign direct investment is an important
   measure to promote urban economic growth, and EII is the most important
   one. However new urbanization would lead to local government
   decision-making competition and then influence EII. Through analyzing
   influence of local government decision-making competition on EII, theory
   guidance could be provided to decision makers of innovation investment.},

Abstract = {Northern Chile has the best worldwide solar energy potential to produce
   energy. Chile can consider this huge potential and meet the demand of
   energy-intensive industry sector, especially mining, due to having
   important mining activities in the north of the country. This paper aims
   to analyze the energy and electricity demand forecasting of mining
   industry and asses the related policy instruments to stimulate renewable
   energy in the mining sector. Key findings of the research are as
   follows: the expected total energy demand value for the mining sector is
   obtained as 405.12 PJ, which means the demand will almost double in 20
   years. The main energy demand share in mining sector belongs to the
   copper sector with 78.9\%. The forecasting results show that this share
   will increase gradually and reach 81.6\% in 2035. The demand for
   electricity and diesel in the copper sector will double in 20 years and
   reach 171.38 PJ and 138.20 PJ, respectively. Electricity has the most
   significant share with 51.9\% in copper energy demand between all fuels,
   and it is followed by diesel (41.8\%), natural gas (3.6\%), and oil
   (2.3\%), accordingly. When energy policy instruments used in the world
   and Chile are compared to promote renewable energy, Chile has
   implemented some of them successfully, particularly renewable
   electricity production without fiscal incentives or FITs. However, Chile
   should also consider the following obligatory regulations in the mining
   industry: priority or guaranteed access to networks, priority dispatch,
   tax credits, production-based incentives and soft loans.},

Abstract = {Low-income households face long-standing challenges of energy insecurity
   and inequality (EII). During extreme events (e.g., disasters and

   populations reliant on energy for health, education, and well-being.
   However, many EII studies rarely incorporate the micro- and
   macro-perspectives of resilience and reliability of energy and internet
   infrastructure and social-psychological factors. To remedy this gap, we
   first address the impacts of extreme events on EII among vulnerable
   populations. Second, we evaluate the driving factors of EII and how they
   change during disasters. Third, we situate these inequalities within
   broader energy systems and pinpoint the importance of equitable
   infrastructure systems by examining infrastructure reliability and
   resilience and the role of renewable technologies. Then, we consider the
   factors influencing energy consumption, such as energy practices,
   socio-psychological factors, and internet access. Finally, we propose
   interdisciplinary research methods to study these issues during extreme
   events and provide recommendations.},

Title = {How energy price changes can affect production- and supply chain
   planning - A case study at.a pulp company},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {333-347},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The process industry in general is very energy -intensive, and therefore
   models focusing on energy can be very important in order to reach higher
   profitability. In this study, an optimization model of the supply chain
   in a pulp company, where energy is included with respect to its revenue
   generating capabilities, is used. Using real company data, and through
   an analysis of the model's results, we show that higher profitability
   can be achieved when integrating energy into the planning process. Our
   findings show that when energy-intensive raw materials not only provide
   fibre to the pulp process but also generate an energy surplus, there is
   room for different planning approaches in order to maximize the total
   profit. This paper reveals promising changes that can be made for
   improving the current planning process. The scenarios considered involve
   market changes for energy demand and price, and also alternative
   production opportunities. A cross-analysis compares the scenarios in
   order to reveal additional relations that are important to consider.
   Depending on a price change of energy, the model prioritizes in its
   selection of pulp products to produce. From this we provide guidelines
   on where and when to increase or decrease pulp production. The model
   shows that the company can increase its total profit no matter which of
   the included energy parameters that increase in price. The paper
   contributes to previous research by enhancing the usefulness of this
   model for not only the case company as such, but also by illustrating
   and describing how the approach applied can be useful for other cases
   within the energy intensive industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Coal-fired power industry has always been the major power source in
   China. As coal-fired power industry consumes around a half of China's
   coal production, it is always thought to be a big air pollutant emission
   source. As more and more strict legislations in coal-fired power
   industry have been issued by the government, the emission performance in
   coal-fired power industry has been drastically reduced recently. Based
   on a brief review of the development of emission control in China's
   coal-fired power industry, the affecting mechanism among the development
   of installed capacities of emission control device, pollutant emission,
   and emission performances in coal-fired power industry is studied.
   According to a systematic study on the development of emissions of
   classified categories, the role of coal-fired power industry as a
   pollutant source is reevaluated. It is found that, coal-fired power
   industry has contributed the most to China's emission reduction, and the
   barycenter of air pollutant emission has been transformed to other high
   energy consumption industries, like heat, iron/steel, and cement. Then
   some development strategies are suggested, such as maintaining the
   current emission standard in coal-fired power industry; expending the
   coal-fired power emission standards to categories of heat generation and
   supply, nonmetallic mineral production and ferrous metals smelting and
   processing; and controlling other heavy metal by consulting the method
   of Hg control.},

Abstract = {We have calculated electron-impact ionization (EII) for P-like systems

   cross sections are compared both with previous FAC calculations, which
   omitted many of these EA channels, and with the available experimental
   results. Moreover, for Fe11+, we find that part of the remaining
   discrepancies between our calculations and recent measurements can be
   accounted for by the inclusion of the resonant excitation double
   autoionization process. Lastly, at the temperatures where each ion is
   predicted to peak in abundances in collisional ionization equilibrium,
   the Maxwellian rate coefficients derived from our calculations differ by
   50\%-7\% from the previous FAC rate coefficients, with the difference
   decreasing with increasing charge.},

Abstract = {In this article, we measure the energy efficiency of 17 sectors in the
   Japanese economy during 19982005 using data envelopment analysis (DEA),
   in which a total-factor framework is applied. We compute the
   total-factor energy efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the
   target energy input suggested by the DEA to the actual energy inputs in
   a sector. Energy, labor, and capital are the three inputs, while the
   value added in each sector is the single output. Our major finding is
   that remarkably energy-inefficient sectors in the Japanese economy
   include energy-intensive industries (i.e., pulp and paper, chemical,
   cement and ceramics, and primary metal sectors) as well as agriculture,
   forestry and fishery, transportation and communication, and
   miscellaneous manufacturing. There is much room to improve energy
   efficiency in Japanese industrial sectors. Moreover, for 8 sectors,
   including energy-intensive industries, the inefficiency of energy use is
   much worse than that of other resource usage.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an energy harvesting quality-of-service
   (EII-QoS) routing protocol based on a deep Q-learning design in
   Internet-of-Things-enabled cognitive radio mobile ad hoc networks
   (IoT-CMANETs), where mobile nodes harvest energy from a multiple
   antennas power beacon for their routing and data transmission processes.
   A deep Q-iearning network (DQN) is proposed to establish a QoS route,
   which avoids the affected region of a primary user. In the forwarding
   route request (RREQ) process, relying on the designed DQN, the proposed
   EII-QoS routing protocol unicasts a RREQ packet to the neighbor
   associated with a minimum Q'-value satisfying energy, queue size of each
   node, the number of hops, and cognitive radio constraints. The Q'-value
   of each link is obtained by optimizing joint residual energy and speed
   of all nodes belonging to this link. Simulation mulls show that the
   proposed EII-QoS routing protocol outperforms the state-of-the-art
   routing protocols in terms of control overhead, packet delivery ratio,
   routing delay, and energy consumption, arising as an effective protocol
   in IoT-CMANETs.},

   the traditional profit maximization objective, the proposed model took
   the minimization of carbon emissions into consideration, and made a fair

   of life product quantity, products sale price, production costs,
   operating costs, collection costs, disposal costs, etc. in this model
   are uncertain, therefore, a finite number of the possible scenarios was
   used to describe it. While it is a way to create more flexibility and
   real-world condition to use the uncertainty of parameters and

Abstract = {To what extent do the welfare costs associated with the implementation
   of the Burden Sharing Agreement in the European Union depend on sectoral
   allocation of emissions rights? What are the prospects for strategic
   climate policy to favor domestic production? This paper attempts to
   answer those questions using a CGE model featuring a detailed
   representation of the European economies. First, numerical simulations
   show that equalizing marginal abatement costs across domestic sectors
   greatly reduces the burden of the emissions constraint but also that
   other allocations may be preferable for some countries because of
   pre-existing tax distortions. Second, we show that the effect of a
   single country's attempt to undertake a strategic policy to limit
   impacts on its domestic energy-intensive industries has mixed effects.
   Exempting energy-intensive industries from the reduction program is a
   costly solution to maintain the international competitiveness of these
   industries; a tax-cum-subsidy approach is shown to be better than
   exemption policy to sustain exports. The welfare impact either policy -
   exemption or subsidy - on other European countries is likely to be small
   because of general equilibrium effects.},

Title = {An efficient scheduling approach for an iron-steel plant equipped with
   self-generation equipment under time-of-use electricity tariffs},
Journal = {SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {60},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Production scheduling under time-of-use electricity tariffs has become
   an efficient way for energy-intensive industries to decrease energy
   costs. However, when production tasks are over-concentrated in one
   scheduling cycle, the effectiveness of time-of-use electricity tariffs
   is no longer significant. This makes the introduction of self-generation
   power plant appealing for energy-intensive industries. This paper
   addresses an integrated scheduling problem from an iron-steel plant
   equipped with self-generation equipment under time-of-use electricity
   tariffs. In this problem, time-of-use electricity tariffs, the
   self-generation cost, and the on-grid electrovalence influence the total
   electricity cost simultaneously. A multi-objective mathematical model
   with energy-awareness is developed to optimize the production schedules
   and electricity cost jointly. An improved SPEA2 based on the
   relationship propagation chain is tailored for the problem, including
   scheduling solution encoding, crossover and mutation. A real-life case
   study from a Chinese iron-steel plant equipped with self-generation
   equipment demonstrates that the proposed methods can provide a
   high-quality scheduling scheme and the total electricity cost can be
   significantly reduced.},

Abstract = {Gossiping (all-to-all broadcast) plays an important role in network

   wide applications of double-face phased array radar in military and
   other special fields, a specific gossiping mechanism for this model is
   needed. In this paper, we consider the gossiping with double-face phased
   array radar model and global topology model. Then a max-group
   coloring-based gossiping mechanism for wireless multi-hop networks is
   proposed. The mechanism introduces virtual nodes and virtual links in
   the topology generating process, and takes the idea of coloring. In
   addition, a direction selecting mechanism is proposed for improving the
   performance of the gossiping process. Finally, the simulations show that
   the proposed mechanism could reduce time consumption significantly.},

Abstract = {The route design of the aircraft in electronic map must consider the

   that it occupies too much machine time and the efficiency is very low.
   To overcome this shortcoming, an improved DP algorithm based on spatial

   under the premise of guaranteeing their geometric shape unchanged, and
   the geography information of the mission area is simplified. Then,
   according to the distance between the objects and the shape of the
   threshold value, the feature groups are combined to reduce the amount of

Abstract = {Scheduling jobs on parallel machines to minimize total tardiness (P//T)
   plays an important role in real applications. The problem of P//T has
   been proved to be NP-hard, and the complexity of computation increases
   heavily with the growing of the number of machines. First, a graphical
   model to describe P//T is constructed in this paper, so that ACO (Ant
   Colony Optimization) can be applied to resolve the problem. Secondly, a
   modified ACO algorithm is developed in which some new computation rules
   are developed to improve the efficiency. Finally, data experiments are
   processed, which demonstrates that the approaches proposed in this paper
   can achieve comparable results to some currently popular algorithms.},

Abstract = {Under the circumstances of multiple weapons cooperative engagement, it
   is becoming more urgent and difficult to coordinate the launch
   sequential timing of different weapons and calculate all the weapons'
   launch timing fast. This paper sets a mixed integer programming model of
   multi-weapon and multi-target, and optimizes the last sequential timing
   to the minimum as the objective, in order to solve the problem of
   scheduling the launch sequential timing of multiple weapons cooperative
   engagement. This paper also designs a fast heuristic algorithm based on
   the priority of tasks, which may help commanders provide a launch
   sequential timing plan with the priority requirement. The paper
   formulates method to handle the trajectory crossing based on time
   dimension optimization, and presents the solving algorithm of launch
   timing and the feasible solution evolution strategy based on space
   compression. The paper sets a case study of 30 weapons to verify the
   model and the algorithm, and have a deep discussion on the feasibility
   of feasible solution evolution strategy. The results show the
   effectiveness of our method on such a problem.},

Title = {Sequential (gemcitabine/vinorelbine) and concurrent (gemcitabine)
   radiochemotherapy with FDG-PET-based target volume definition in locally
   advanced non-small cell lung cancer: first results of a phase I/eII
   study},
Journal = {BMC CANCER},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 28},
Abstract = {Background: The aim of the study was to determine the maximal tolerated
   dose (MTD) of gemcitabine every two weeks concurrent to radiotherapy,
   administered during an aggressive program of sequential and simultaneous
   radiochemotherapy for locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung
   cancer (NSCLC) and to evaluate the efficacy of this regime in a phase II
   study.
   Methods: 33 patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC were enrolled
   in a combined radiochemotherapy protocol. 29 patients were assessable
   for evaluation of toxicity and tumor response. Treatment included two
   cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1200 mg/m(2)) and
   vinorelbine (30 mg/m(2)) at day 1, 8 and 22, 29 followed by concurrent
   radiotherapy (2.0 Gy/ d; total dose 66.0 Gy) and chemotherapy with
   gemcitabine every two weeks at day 43, 57 and 71. Radiotherapy planning
   included {[}F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG
   PET) based target volume definition. 10 patients were included in the
   phase I study with an initial gemcitabine dose of 300 mg/m(2). The dose
   of gemcitabine was increased in steps of 100 mg/ m(2) until the MTD was
   realized.
   Results: MTD was defined for the patient group receiving gemcitabine 500
   mg/m(2) due to grade 2 ( next to grade 3) esophagitis in all patients
   resulting in a mean body weight loss of 5 kg (SD = 1.4 kg), representing
   8\% of the initial weight. These patients showed persisting dysphagia 3
   to 4 weeks after completing radiotherapy. In accordance with expected
   complications as esophagitis, dysphagia and odynophagia, we defined the
   MTD at this dose level, although no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) grade 3
   was reached. In the phase I/II median follow-up was 15.7 months (4.1 to
   42.6 months). The overall response rate after completion of therapy was
   64\%. The median overall survival was 19.9 (95\% CI: {[}10.1; 29.7])
   months for all eligible patients. The median disease-free survival for
   all patients was 8.7 ( 95\% CI: {[}2.7; 14.6]) months.
   Conclusion: After induction chemotherapy, the maximum tolerated dose and
   frequency of gemcitabine was defined at 500 mg/m(2) every two weeks in
   three cycles during a maximum of 7 weeks of thoracic radiotherapy for
   the phase II study. This regimen represents an effective and tolerable
   therapy in the treatment of NSCLC.},

Abstract = {Soundscape research has acquired a paramount role in biodiversity
   conservation as it may provide timely and reliable information about the
   ecological integrity. The relationship between soundscape complexity and
   ecological integrity in highly biodiverse environments, as well as the
   factors affecting this relationship require a thorough understanding. We
   determined how the soundscape relates to the landscape ecological
   integrity at different spatial and temporal scales in a montane forest
   in the northern Andes of Colombia. Between May-July 2018 we obtained
   acoustic recordings from 31 sampling sites in the protected area of a
   hydropower plant, and estimated nine acoustic indices and an ecological
   integrity index (EII) derived from fragmentation, connectivity, and
   habitat quality. Five of the acoustic indices, linked to the evenness of
   the acoustic signals and levels of the biophonic signals, were
   associated with changes in the EII and indicated the presence of more
   even, saturated, and acoustically rich soundscapes in sites with higher
   integrity. Relationships between acoustic indices and the EII were
   stronger at a smaller spatial scale (100 m) and responded to daily
   variation of the soundscape, with the strongest associations occurring
   mainly from sunrise to noon. We show that acoustic indices measuring the
   evenness of the acoustic activity distribution and the number of
   frequency peaks reliably reflect the changes in the ecological
   integrity, and can be integrated with remote sensing as a tool for
   landscape management. Our results highlight the soundscape analysis as a
   feasible approach for the monitoring and conservation planning of
   acoustically unknown and threatened Andean landscapes. (C) 2021

Title = {Would different methodologies for assessing carbon leakage exposure lead
   to different risk levels? A case study of the Brazilian industry},
Journal = {CLIMATE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1102-1116},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Energy-intensive industries play an important role in low-carbon
   development, being particularly exposed to climate policies. Concern
   over possible carbon leakage in this sector poses a major challenge for
   designing effective carbon pricing instruments (CPI). Different
   methodologies for assessing carbon leakage exposure are currently used
   by different jurisdictions, each of them based on different approaches
   and indicators. This paper aims to analyse the extent to which the use
   of different methodologies leads to different results in terms of
   exposure to the risk of carbon leakage, using the Brazilian industry
   sector as a case study. Results indicate that carbon leakage exposure is
   an expected outcome of eventual CPI implementation in Brazilian
   industry. However, results vary according to the chosen methodology, so
   the definition of the criteria is paramount for assessing sectoral
   exposure to the risk of carbon leakage. Key policy insights Despite
   increasing discussion about the implementation of carbon pricing on the
   Brazilian industrial sector, the evaluation of carbon leakage risks is
   still neglected. Assessments of the risk of carbon leakage are directly
   related to the indicators and criteria used by each methodology. Thus, a
   given subsector may present different levels of exposure to carbon
   leakage depending on the methodological choice. More than a purely
   technical discussion, the methodological definition of carbon leakage
   risk is a political discussion - it can be well-conducted, leading to
   the success of a CPI, or even sabotaged, by implicitly subsidizing
   energy-intensive industries.},

Abstract = {The high proportion of energy costs in the costs of production makes the
   pursuit of the energy concept in sugar factories, as in energy-intensive
   industries in general, an important component of business strategy. The
   evolution of electricity and fuel prices over the coming years is
   difficult to forecast for various reasons (effects of environmental
   protection and emission trading, growing scarcity of oil and natural
   gas, etc.). For the medium term, rising energy prices are to be
   expected. Again this background, thinking in energy-intensive industries
   is currently moving in the following directions:
   - Step-by-step expansion of energy production building on a
   cost-effective basic process, e.g. installation of a low-pressure boiler
   with a one-stage steam turbine set. The basic process can later be
   expanded to agas or steam turbine power plant or to a coal powerplant.
   - Energy concept with coal and/or substitute fuels as the primary energy
   sources. Uncertain here is the price development of the substitute fuels
   (additional payment currently about EURO50/t).
   - Use of various fuels. In order to take into account the different
   development of fuel prices, the concepts under planning embrace two
   fuels, residues/substitutes and natural gas.
   Cost-effectiveness remains the decisive factor. With combined heat-power
   plants, the price difference between electricity and fuels is the most
   important magnitude with a view to the amortization period. Energy
   plants are capital-intensive, and a point to be considered is whether
   these plants can be better utilized by increasing production.},

Title = {Multi-scale ecological operation model of reservoir group coupled with
   ecological infiltration irrigation},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {270},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Aiming at the extensive management problems in ecological operation and
   ecological irrigation, this paper proposed a novel ecological irrigation
   method-ecological infiltration irrigation (EII), and established a
   multiscale ecological operation model of reservoir group coupled with EH
   for the irrigation and restoration of river valley grasslands. Firstly,
   the ecological available water supplies in ecological periods were
   obtained by long-term ecological operation. Then, reservoirs on
   mainstream and tributaries gathered flood peaks through real-time
   ecological operation to create artificial ecological flood processes.
   Finally, by the joint operation of EII projects, the water level of
   artificial flood was raised, and the artificial flood was controllably
   introduced into irrigation districts for the precision irrigation of
   river valley grasslands. The rationality of ecological operation model
   and the feasibility of EH technology were then verified through case
   analysis. Results indicate that: (1) through the 5-9-13 division of
   ecological irrigation districts, analysis of the ecological water
   demand, multiscale ecological operation, EH technology and projects, and
   other measures, suitable artificial floods can be created and fully
   introduced into ecological irrigation districts to realize the timely
   and appropriate irrigation of river valley grasslands; (2) in the
   critical ecological period in 2018, the core protected area was
   basically fully irrigated through EII, with an effective irrigation rate
   of 82.4\% and a vegetation coverage of 74.8\%, which basically met the
   ecological water demand of river valley forests and grasses; and (3) for
   animal husbandry, after using EH technology for grassland irrigation,
   the average forage yield of river valley grasslands has an increase of
   25\%, and the direct economic benefit has an average increase of 18.9
   million yuan per year, effectively improving the economic income of
   local herdsmen. The research results have important theoretical and
   practical significance for the ecological protection and restoration of
   river valley vegetation.},

Title = {Quantifying the Techno-Economic Potential of Grid-Tied Rooftop Solar
   Photovoltaics in the Philippine Industrial Sector},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The industrial sector is a major contributor to the economic growth of
   the Philippines. However, it is also one of the top consumers of energy,
   which is produced mainly from fossil fuels. The Philippine industrial
   sector must therefore be supported economically while minimizing the
   emissions associated with energy consumption. A potential strategy for
   minimizing costs and emissions is the installation of solar photovoltaic
   (PV) modules on the rooftops of industrial facilities, but this approach
   is hindered by existing energy policies in the country. In this work, we
   performed a techno-economic assessment on the implementation of rooftop
   solar PV in Philippine industrial facilities under different policy
   scenarios. Our study considered 139 randomly sampled industrial plants
   under MERALCO franchise area in the Philippines. Under the current net
   metering policy, 132 of the evaluated facilities were economically
   viable for the integration of rooftop solar PV. This corresponds to an
   additional 1035 MWp of solar PV capacity and the avoidance of 8.4
   million tons of CO2 emissions with minimal financial risk. In
   comparison, an expanded net metering policy supports the deployment of
   4653 MWp of solar PV and the avoidance of 38 million tons of CO2. By
   enabling an enhanced net metering policy, the widespread application of
   rooftop solar PV may present considerable savings and emission reduction
   for energy-intensive industries (electrical and semiconductors, cement
   and concrete, steel and metals, and textile and garments) and lower
   generation costs for less energy intensive industries (construction and
   construction materials, transportation and logistics, and food and
   beverages).},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {With the assistance of the LEAP (long-range energy alternatives
   planning) energy modeling tool, this study explores the energy
   efficiency and CO2 emission reduction potential of the iron and steel
   industry in Turkey. With a share of 35\%, the steel and iron industry is
   considered as the most energy-consuming sector in Turkey. The study
   explores that the energy intensity rate can be lowered by 13\%, 38\% and
   51\% in SEI (slow-speed energy efficiency improvement), AEI
   (accelerating energy efficiency improvement) and CPT (cleaner production
   and technology scenario) scenarios, respectively. Particularly the
   projected aggregated energy savings of the scenarios CPT and AES are
   very promising with saving rates of 33.7\% and 23\% respectively.
   Compared to baseline scenarios, energy efficiency improvements
   correspond to economic potential of 0.1 billion dollars for SEI, 1.25
   dollars for AEI and 1.8 billion dollars for CPT scenarios annually.
   Concerning GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, in 2030 the iron and steel
   industry in Turkey is estimated to produce 34.9 MtCO(2) in BAU
   (business-as-usual scenario), 32.5 MtCO(2) in SEI, 24.6 MtCO(2) in AEI
   and 14.5 MtCO(2) in CPT a scenario which corresponds to savings of
   9\%-39\%. The study reveals that energy consumption and GHG emissions of
   the iron and steel industry can be lowered significantly if the
   necessary measures are implemented. It is expected that this study will
   fill knowledge gaps pertaining to energy efficiency potential in Turkish
   energy intensive industries and help stake-holders in energy intensive
   industries to realize the potential for energy efficiency and GHG
   mitigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fabrication of Micro-Needle Electrodes for Bio-Signal Recording by a
   Magnetization-Induced Self-Assembly Method},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Micro-needle electrodes (MEs) have attracted more and more attention for
   monitoring physiological electrical signals, including electrode-skin
   interface impedance (EII), electromyography (EMG) and
   electrocardiography (ECG) recording. A magnetization-induced
   self-assembling method (MSM) was developed to fabricate a microneedle
   array (MA). A MA coated with Ti/Au film was assembled as a ME. The
   fracture and insertion properties of ME were tested by experiments. The
   bio-signal recording performance of the ME was measured and compared
   with a typical commercial wet electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode). The results
   show that the MA self-assembled from the magnetic droplet array under
   the sum of gravitational surface tension and magnetic potential
   energies. The ME had good toughness and could easily pierce rabbit skin
   without being broken or buckling. When the compression force applied on
   the ME was larger than 2 N, ME could stably record EII, which was a
   lower value than that measured by Ag/AgCl electrodes. EMG signals
   collected by ME varied along with the contraction of biceps brachii
   muscle. ME could record static ECG signals with a larger amplitude and
   dynamic ECG signals with more distinguishable features in comparison
   with a Ag/AgCl electrode, therefore, ME is an alternative electrode for
   bio-signal monitoring in some specific situations.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {356},
Pages = {7-13},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {We have investigated electron-impact ionization (EII) for the ground
   level 5d(4)6s D-6(1/2) and the two metastable levels 5d(5) S-6(5/2) and
   5d(3)6s(2) F-4(3/2) of W+ forming W2+ by theoretical calculation using
   the flexible atomic code based on a distorted-wave (DW) approximation.
   It is found that the direct ionization (DI) of a 5d and 6s electron is
   largely sensitive to the choice of optimization configurations for the
   single, atomic local central potential used in bound and continuum
   orbitals descriptions of both the initial and the final states. The DI
   cross section is reduced by as much as 60\% for the variation of the
   optimization configurations. Indirect excitation-autoionization (EA)
   cross sections for the 5d and 6s -> nl (5 <= nl <= 30) and 4f, 5s and 5p
   -> nl (n = 5 and 6) transitions have been calculated with the detailed
   branching ratios. Experiments are about 28\% lower than our theoretical
   predictions for the total EII cross sections of the ground level 5d(4)6s
   D-6(1/2) and the metastable level 5d(5) S-6(5/2) at the peak. This is
   due to the large contribution of the EA though the DI cross section is
   significantly reduced than previous theoretical works and experiments.

Abstract = {Currently, energy consumption reduction is playing a more and more
   important role in production and manufacturing, especially for
   energy-intensive industries. An optimal production scheduling can help
   reduce unnecessary energy consumption. This paper considers an identical
   parallel machine scheduling problem to minimize simultaneously two
   objectives: the total energy consumption (TEC) and the makespan. To
   tackle this NP-hard problem, an augmented c-constraint method is applied
   to obtain an optimal Pareto front for small-scale instances. For
   medium-and large-scale instances, a constructive heuristic method with a
   local search strategy is proposed and the NSGA-Il algorithm is applied
   to obtain good approximate Pareto fronts. Extensive computational

Title = {A suggested approach to site storage resources in transmission planning

Journal = {MRS ENERGY \& SUSTAINABILITY},

Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Placing a large storage project at one transmission node influences the
   transmission flows in the model. Hence, planners need an approach that
   estimates future storage services and logically places storage at
   multiple transmission nodes.
   In planning models, it is hard to forecast which service storage might
   provide at any given hour because storage provides a wide variety of
   services such as capacity benefit, peaker replacement, reduction in
   renewable energy curtailment, and ancillary services. But transmission
   planning models are required to address North American Electric
   Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability standards and criteria, with
   assumptions for planned additions of generation, transmission, and
   demand response resources. Hence, planners must assume a basic set of
   services for storage resources.
   And this paper outlines a suggested approach to site storage resources
   in planning models by focusing on the generator interconnection queue
   for utility-scale storage and energy-intensive industries for commercial
   and industrial customers.},

Title = {The influence of ambidextrous leadership on the employee innovative
   behavior: an empirical study based on Chinese manufacturing enterprises},
Journal = {CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY},
Abstract = {Employees are the core asset of every company. Employees' innovative
   behavior (EIB) helps to improve the performance of enterprises.
   High-quality leadership is one of the key factors to promote employee
   innovation. As companies pay more attention to innovation, the attention
   to EIB continues to increase. In the process of employee innovation, the
   leadership style of the company's senior managers plays an important
   role. This is mostly so in ambidextrous leadership (AL) enveronment
   where paradox and contradictory thinking needs to be explored on EIB.
   Based on the theories of innovation and leadership, this paper explored
   the impact of AL on EIB and its mechanisms. We analyzed data on 478
   staff working in industrial enterprises in China.The empirical results
   revealed a positive correlation between AL and EIB and the role of
   creative self-efficacy (CS) and cognitive flexibility (CF). The analysis
   of the mediating effect of multi-level regulation shows that: firstly,
   CS acts as an intermediary between AL and employee's incremental
   innovation (EII) and employee's radical innovation (ERI); secondly, CF
   positively adjusts the relationship between AL an d CS. Lastly, AL
   indirectly affects EII and ERI through CS, and this positive indirect
   relationship is more pronounced when CF is higher. The observations of
   the study provide a new perspective for leaders to break the traditional
   single behavior path and adopt dynamic complementary AL behavior to
   improve the level of employee innovation. Again, these insightful
   revelations have important practical significance for enterprise
   innovation management to adopt the appropriate remedial measures that
   will strengthen and deepen employee's innovative behavior for optimal
   gains. This study helps to deepen the understanding of the influence
   mechanism of EIB, improves innovation efficiency literature and promotes
   the healthy development of enterprises.},

   optimization problem is solved using Multiparametric Programming (mp),
   separately from the scheduling problem. Based on the solution from the
   mp-MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem, several production
   scheduling problems with sensitivity information from the mp-MILP
   solution embedded can be solved in parallel in order to find the
   system-optimal solution. The approach is tested on realistic data
   instances of a stainless-steel process and obtains the optimal solution.
   However, the computational performance is strongly limited to very small
   instances due to limitations of the mp-MILP solvers.},

Abstract = {The decision of the European Union to tighten climate policy has
   introduced new goals for the energy supply industry. The emission of CO2

   Such new targets will have significant impact on power production

   production is based on fossil fuels. This paper deals with the
   optimization of electricity production, taking into account the need to
   balance the demand for power and energy, and the fulfilment of climate
   policy goals. The presented methodologies for Energy Mix optimization
   are illustrated by the case study for Poland, an economy in which nearly
   90\% of electricity production is based on coal. Such economies have to
   undertake the largest transformation to follow the European climate

Abstract = {Efficient frameworks for scheduling of energy-intensive industries are
   important enablers for the industrial implementation of the demand-side
   management concept (DSM). DSM enables enterprises to cut their energy
   cost as well as to support the grid in dealing with fluctuating
   availability of energy. In this work, we present an improvement of the
   energy-aware production scheduling strategy reported in Hadera et
   al.,(1) which is based upon a continuous-time scheduling formulation.
   The improvement concerns the modeling of the coupling between the
   scheduling problem and the computation of the energy bill. The resulting
   optimization problem is solved by the heuristic bilevel decomposition
   from Hadera et al.(2) Numerical studies showed that although the
   proposed formulation and heuristic decomposition does not guarantee to
   obtain the global minimum it does provide good quality solutions within
   reasonable solution times. The new energy-awareness formulation reduces
   the number of binary variables and constraints and results in shorter
   solution times.},

Title = {A Hybrid Method for Provincial Scale Energy-related Carbon Emission
   Allocation in China},

Abstract = {Achievement of carbon emission reduction targets proposed by national
   governments relies on provincial/state allocations. In this study, a
   hybrid method for provincial energy-related carbon emissions allocation
   in China was developed to provide a good balance between production- and
   consumption-based approaches. In this method, provincial energy-related
   carbon emissions are decomposed into direct emissions of local
   activities other than thermal power generation and indirect emissions as
   a result of electricity consumption. Based on the carbon reduction
   efficiency principle, the responsibility for embodied emissions of
   provincial product transactions is assigned entirely to the production
   area. The responsibility for carbon generation during the production of
   thermal power is borne by the electricity consumption area, which
   ensures that different regions with resource endowments have rational
   development space. Empirical studies were conducted to examine the
   hybrid method and three indices, per capita GDP, resource endowment
   index and the proportion of energy-intensive industries, were screened
   to preliminarily interpret the differences among China's regional carbon
   emissions. Uncertainty analysis and a discussion of this method are also
   provided herein.},

Abstract = {Energy-efficient scheduling is highly necessary for energy-intensive
   industries, such as glass, mould or chemical production. Inspired by a
   real-world glass-ceramics production process, this paper investigates a
   bi-criteria energy-efficient two-stage hybrid flow shop scheduling
   problem, in which parallel machines with eligibility are at stage 1 and
   a batch machine is at stage 2. The performance measures considered are
   makespan and total energy consumption. Time-of-use (TOU) electricity
   prices and different states of machines (working, idle and turnoff) are
   integrated. To tackle this problem, a mixed integer programming (MIP) is
   formulated, based on which an augmented epsilon-constraint (AUGMECON)
   method is adopted to obtain the exact Pareto front. A problem-tailored
   constructive heuristic method with local search strategy, a bi-objective
   tabu search algorithm and a bi-objective ant colony optimisation
   algorithm are developed to deal with medium- and large-scale problems.
   Extensive computational experiments are conducted, and a real-world case
   is solved. The results show effectiveness of the proposed methods, in
   particular the bi-objective tabu search.},

Abstract = {Energy is an indispensable resource in manufacturing, and it carries
   both financial and environmental pressures for enterprises. Considering
   this importance, this research presents an optimization framework to
   allow energy -intensive industries to move towards energy-carbon

   integrating renewable energy system decisions into production
   scheduling, incorporating solar photovoltaic modules and energy storage
   systems, and leveraging energy policies, such as net metering programs,
   that provide credits for net excess generation. The proposed
   optimization framework is built under a multi-objective Mixed Integer
   Linear Programming formulation, using time-indexed variables. The model
   is showcased within the context of a case study involving an
   energy-intensive plastic injection molding process. Furthermore, a
   robust optimization approach using Monte Carlo simulations is presented
   for the construction of confidence intervals used in estimating the
   lifespan of solar installations. Results demonstrate that manufacturing

   storage dispatching capability are more cost competitive to lower net

Abstract = {The increasing challenges to the grid stability posed by the penetration

   novel scheduling model for a multi-stage multi-line process, which
   incorporates both the critical manufacturing constraints and the
   technical requirements imposed by the market. Using mixed integer
   programming approach, two optimization problems are formulated to
   sequentially minimize the cost in a day-ahead energy market and maximize
   the reserve provision when participating in the ancillary market. The
   effectiveness of day-ahead scheduling model has been verified for the
   case of a real metal casting plant in the Nordic market, where a
   significant reduction of energy cost is obtained. Furthermore, the
   reserve provision is shown to be a potential tool for capitalizing on

Abstract = {Taiwan, a country in the subtropics, heavily depends on imported energy
   with over 99\% of its energy imported. In this regard, scrap tires for
   use as an energy source has thus became attractive in the past two
   decades. The objective of this article is to present a comprehensive
   analysis of tire-to-energy in Taiwan. This article gives a concise
   summary of the current status of scrap tire production and its recycling
   in recent years. It was found that a major scrap tire market in Taiwan
   (about three-quarters) is used as fuel in the cement, power, and paper
   and pulp utilities. Under the authorization of the Energy Management
   Law, the central competent authority has promulgated the regulations to
   encourage energy-intensive industries to participate in the cogeneration
   system through excess electricity purchase and financial incentives.
   Using the method recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change, the total energy potential and the environmental benefit of
   mitigating CO2 emissions in place of coal were preliminarily calculated
   to be around 1,920 TJ and 4.1 x 10(7) kg, respectively, based on the

Abstract = {Emission Trading System (ETS) has been promoted as a tool for providing
   financial and cost-effective incentives to the GHG emitters to implement
   emission reduction measures. The ETS has been applied in many
   energy-intensive industries internationally. However, its implementation
   in building sector appears encountering many challenges due to the
   unique characteristics of buildings. This study attempts to identify and
   analyze the key factors within the context of China. Research data are
   from semi-structured interviews with a selected group of ETS experts
   from official and academia. Fifteen representative factors have been
   identified from extensive content analysis and validated with experts'
   opinions. Among these representative factors, some are key factors
   playing critical and essential roles. This paper applies the Social
   Network Analysis (SNA) to find the key factors. Finally, it is found
   that there are four factors considered as the most important influence
   factors, including ``government{''}, ``emitters{''}, ``the scattered
   energy consumption and carbon emission in building sector{''}, and
   ``decentralization of property rights in building sector{''}. The
   findings from the study provide valuable reference for decision-making
   in promoting ETS in those developing countries such as China where

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {For electricity grids with an increasing share of intermittent
   renewables, the power generation mix can have significant daily
   variations. This leads to time-dependent emission intensities and
   volatile electricity prices in the day-ahead and spot market tariffs
   that can be better utilised by energy intensive industries such as water
   supply utilities. A multi-objective optimisation method for scheduling
   the operation of pumps is investigated in this paper for the reduction
   of both electricity costs and greenhouse gas emissions for a benchmark
   water distribution system. A set of energy supply scenarios has been
   formulated based on future projections from National Grid plc (UK) in
   order to investigate the range of cost savings and emission reductions
   that could be possibly achieved. Pump scheduling options with fixed
   time-of-use and day ahead market tariffs are analysed in order to
   compare potential reduction tradeoffs for both electricity costs and
   greenhouse gas emissions using Pareto optimality. The presented analysis
   concludes that the explicit inclusion of greenhouse gas emission
   reductions in optimising the scheduling of pumps operation in water
   distribution systems could provide considerable benefits; however, more
   compelling fiscal and regulatory incentives are needed. (C) 2017 The

   through an iterative action research (AR) study carried out in two
   small-sized industrial enterprise engaged in foundry and textile

   programme guided by the proposed framework improved the eco-efficiency
   of textile mill by 1.2\% and foundry by 4\%. The paper exemplifies the

   energy reduction for many years, which becomes more and more obvious
   with acceleration of urbanization; although it can lead to more energy

   positive effect of the rising tertiary industry with low energy
   intensity, such as real estate, finance and insurance, resident service

   counteracted the negative effect of other energy-intensive industries;
   urbanization process has exerted an effect on energy structure directly

Title = {Electrical load tracking scheduling of steel plants under time-of-use
   tariffs},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {137},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Electrical load tracking is a critical strategy for energy intensive
   industries to provide demand response (DR) in today's electricity
   markets. It can take advantage of time-of-use (TOU) tariffs in
   steelmaking-refining-continuous casting (SRCC) scheduling. In this
   paper, we develop a continuous-time mixed integer nonlinear programming
   (MINLP) model subject to energy-awareness and TOU tariffs to manage the
   electrical load tracking scheduling of SRCC. Due to the complex cases
   among load intervals of electrical load tracking, time-slots of TOU
   tariffs and processing cycles of jobs result from different time
   granularities of the electrical load tracking and TOU tariffs, we
   formulate the objective functions with derived general formulations that
   can apply to all cases. An improved strength Pareto evolutionary
   algorithm 2, AHSPEA2, is developed to solve this proposed model, whose
   search ability and population diversity are enhanced greatly by two
   strategies, the arithmetic crossover operator and the improved hybrid
   self-adaptive mutation operators. The computational results demonstrate
   that AHSPEA2 is far superior and prove its effectiveness in providing
   high-quality scheduling plans which follow the pre-contracted load curve
   carefully to decrease deviations and reduce electricity costs
   simultaneously.},

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {29},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {During the 1990s, Brazilian industry accounted for over 34\% of CO2
   emissions deriving from fossil fuel consumption, and over 58\% of the
   net CO2 emissions deriving From biomass consumption. Such as the energy
   intensity indicator commonly used to measure the energy consumption
   efficiency of the industrial sector, the emission intensity indicator
   was adopted to measure the CO2 emission efficiency in economic terms.
   However, this indicator masks key variables in the analysis, such as the
   structure of the industrial park, the average monetary value of
   production and the growth in industrial output. The effect of these
   variables becomes apparent when comparing the development of emission
   intensity with the development of energy intensity, through a third
   indicator: the specific energy emission. In this article, this
   comparison is based on a prospective analysis carried out through the
   IEPM model for three different energy consumption growth scenarios for
   Brazil's industrial sector. According to the results, it is possible to
   conclude that even with a high share of biomass sources in Brazil's
   energy grid, maintenance of the industrial production structure based on
   energy-intensive industries that produce low added value goods is not
   environmentally suitable. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {With rapid urbanization and the requirements for new buildings and

   Meanwhile, China's energy consumption and carbon emissions associated

   one of the most energy intensive industries. Introducing new and more
   pertinent technologies with better management, as indicated by
   government goals and measures, can improve energy efficiency and reduce
   carbon emission. However, many challenges and uncertainties in the
   cement industry have been addressed without considering several
   interconnected processes among sectors including industry, energy,
   construction, and services, which lead to little improvements in the
   industry. Nexus approaches are recognized as effective methods to
   simultaneously examine interactions among multiple sectors with various
   elements. This research intends to provide insights for future
   energy-cement-carbon emission nexus, through integrated assessment
   capabilities, related to China's new urbanization planning toward 2050.
   Several challenges and uncertainties, including different trends in
   population growth, structural transformation of economic driving forces,
   and new but stricter policy targets for resource use efficiency and
   environment production, are put into multiple scenarios. The results of
   our analysis provide perspectives on future direction to underscore the
   growing interconnection among energy, cement and carbon emission with
   clear and more specific roadmap for promoting integrated planning,

Abstract = {Decarbonization is a critical issue for peaking CO2 emissions of
   energy-intensive industries, such as the iron and steel industry. The
   decarbonization options of China's ironmaking and steelmaking sector
   were discussed based on a systematic three-dimensional low-carbon
   analysis from the aspects of resource utilization (Y), energy
   utilization (Q), and energy cleanliness which is evaluated by a process
   general emission factor (PGEF) on all the related processes, including
   the current blast furnace (BF)-basic oxygen furnace (BOF) integrated
   process and the specific sub-processes, as well as the electric arc
   furnace (EAF) process, typical direct reduction (DR) process, and
   smelting reduction (SR) process. The study indicates that the
   three-dimensional aspects, particularly the energy structure, should be
   comprehensively considered to quantitatively evaluate the
   decarbonization road map based on novel technologies or processes.
   Promoting scrap utilization (improvement of Y) and the substitution of
   carbon-based energy (improvement of PGEF) in particular is critical. In
   terms of process scale, promoting the development of the scrap-based EAF
   or DR-EAF process is highly encouraged because of their lower PGEF. The
   three-dimensional method is expected to extend to other processes or
   industries, such as the cement production and thermal electricity
   generation industries.},

Abstract = {Since 2016 and guided by the National Vision 2030, the energy transition
   in Saudi Arabia has gained significant momentum. There have been
   important energy subsidy reforms and dynamic developments in the
   renewable energy sector. This paper provides a systematic view of the
   Saudi energy transition by highlighting drivers, sectors, targets and
   processes. It analyzes the progress with regard to lowering carbon
   emissions and consumption, as well as introducing ambitious new targets
   and solar energy projects. The energy subsidy reforms have delivered the
   needed funds for the energy transition and allowed for more
   participation in the energy markets. Other aspects of the energy
   transition included low-carbon urban developments and energy efficiency
   measures in the building sectors. Besides, key energy-intensive
   industries such as petrochemicals and desalination are incorporating
   renewables and facilitating the use of clean energy. Overall, the Saudi
   energy transition is underway, and it holds significant and necessary
   adjustments to the most important economy in the Middle East region. It
   needs to be complemented by environmental awareness and sustainable
   lifestyles. Reforming the large carbon economy of Saudi Arabia towards
   more sustainability and environmental responsibility can have positive
   spillovers and powerful messages about the future of carbon-fuel
   exporting states. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {In this study, energy efficiency applications and corresponding energy
   saving results were evaluated in a Turkish fabric dyeing factory. The
   relationship between energy consumption and the production were
   evaluated by regression analysis. They were detailed with energy
   intensity index (EII), cumulative sum values (CUSUM), specific energy
   consumption (SEC), and radar chart. The energy efficiency efforts should
   be initiated from heat and electrical energy, which are the main energy
   types extensively used in the textile industry. Average energy
   consumption value of the last four years (2015-2018), which is 7134 TOE
   is reduced 49\% including waste heat, flash steam and cooling water
   recovery, and insulation in dyeing machines, in the factory due to the
   implementation of the energy saving actions. Accordingly, a reduction of
   25\% SEC value is possible. Moreover, production planning has a
   significant impact on the total energy consumption in terms of full load
   capacity operation of the dyeing machines, which may cause 23\% energy
   saving that is of great importance.},

Abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises air pollution as a
   serious public health concern in many developing countries due to the
   influx of energy-intensive industries with limited planning and exposure
   mitigation strategies. Due to industrial expansion and release of
   associated air pollutants in Oman, the US Environmental Protection
   Agency human health risk assessment (HHRA) model was used to determine
   the non-carcinogenic hazard associated with exposure to industrial
   emissions. Across the three industrial cities (Nizwa, Sur and Rusayl),
   the study found ambient average concentrations (mu g/m(3)) of 1 h carbon
   monoxide (CO) (606-1974), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (7.7-43.9) and sulfur
   dioxide (SO2) (4.8-9.0) and 24 h PM2.5 (7.3-7.8) and PM10 (38.7-51.5) to
   be significantly lower than both the Ministry of Environment and
   Climatic Affairs (MECA) and WHO limits. The HHRA analysis showed that
   exposure to the air pollutants produced low non-carcinogenic adverse
   health effects, as the hazard quotient (HQ) was found to be <1 among the
   population. However, there was an increase in HQ for WHO reference
   exposure level (REL) values compared with that of MECA; this is due to
   the relaxed/high REL limits of the latter. Future epidemiological
   studies involving long-term air pollution exposure assessment and health
   data may improve the reliability of the current HHRA estimates.},

Abstract = {Reusing heat through process integration in heat exchanger networks has
   long been a key measure for increasing energy efficiency in
   energy-intensive industries. Thermal pinch analysis is commonly used for
   a systematic matching of process streams and thus planning of optimal
   process integration in large chemical plants. The possible savings
   increase with the amount of heat and the number of integrated process
   streams. Therefore co- siting of several companies in a symbiotic
   network opens new opportunities for process integration even in small
   and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), but also introduces new challenges.
   Thermal pinch analysis is extended here to account for piping distances
   and fluctuations and limited availability of energy flows by adding
   additional costs for the piping system and a backup utility system in
   the optimization function. Cooperative game theory is proposed to derive
   a sharing of savings between the partners of the industrial symbiosis
   that is optimal for each partner and should prevent partners from
   leaving the network because of higher benefits in a subgroup or alone.
   It is argued that knowledge about the optimality of a network for each
   partner creates trust between the partners that is a necessary base for
   the long-term commitment needed in industrial symbioses. An exemplary
   symbiotic network combining the production of pulp and woody biomass
   energy carriers is used to illustrate the proposed approaches.},

Abstract = {To address the global challenge of the climate change, more strict
   legislations worldwide on carbon emission reductions have put energy
   intensive industries under immense pressure to improve the energy
   efficiency. Due to the lack of technical support and financial
   incentives, a range of technical and economic barriers still exist for
   small-medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper first introduces a point
   energy technology, which is developed for SMEs to improve the insight of
   the energy usage in the manufacturing processes and installed in a local
   bakery. Statistical analysis of electricity consumption data over a
   seven-day period is conducted, including the identification of
   operational modes for individual processing units using an enhanced
   clustering method and the voltage unbalance conditions associated with
   these identified modes. Two technical strategies, namely electrical load
   allotment and voltage unbalance minimisation, are then proposed, which
   could attain more than 800 kwh energy saving during this period and the
   current unbalance could be reduced to less than 10\%. In addition, the
   genetic algorithm is deployed to solve the job shop scheduling problem
   based upon the commercial electrical tariffs, and this reduces the
   electricity bill by 80 pound per day in the case study. Implementation
   of the recommendations based on the above analysis therefore may
   potentially yield significant financial and environmental benefits. (C)

Abstract = {The multiple effect evaporator (MEE) system is a typical process for
   liquor concentration in the energy-intensive industries. Many approaches
   and commercial software have been widely used for MEE simulation and
   optimization. However, the existing work usually assumes simplified
   correlations for material thermodynamic properties and evaporator
   operations to avoid computational complexity, which may cause a large
   deviation in results. This Article addresses accurate and detailed unit
   operations and material properties to model the MEE systems and further
   heat integration for optimal energy recovery. To deal with the resulting
   complex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems of MEE
   systems, an efficient optimization strategy is developed, where the
   noncritical variables in the MINLP model are initialized as parameters
   and updated by solving a series of mixed integer linear programming
   (MILP) problems using a two-stage iterative procedure. An industrial
   scale problem for concentrating black liquor in a Chinese paper mill is
   carried out to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the new
   approach. On the basis of the conditions of constant heat-transfer
   coefficients and stream boiling point rises assumed in the well-known
   commercial software WinGEMS, our method performs identically to WinGEMS
   in five distinct scenarios. Moreover, our method is more capable of
   solving industrial problems in practical situations including varying
   stream thermal properties and evaporator heat-transfer coefficients,
   achieving up to 25\% of energy conservation in a real-world case.},

Abstract = {A huge amount of waste heat is emitted annually to the environment by
   energy intensive industries. Thermally activated advanced absorption
   cycles can be promising candidates for utilizing the waste heat of
   industry sector. In such absorption systems, it is desirable to utilize
   the waste heat from industries for heating and cooling applications in
   commercial and residential sectors. For this purpose, it is necessary to
   transport energy over some distance because the waste heat source and
   demand are generally located apart from each other.
   Transportation of steam, hot water or chilled water requires high
   construction costs for insulation. There is an efficient method of
   energy transportation using absorption system called ``solution
   transportation absorption (STA) system{''}. The solution is transported
   at an ambient temperature so that tube-insulation is not required.
   This paper shows system analysis of the above-mentioned system and the
   optimal result, using mathematical optimization. The mathematical model
   is a demand driven linear programming (LP) optimization model which
   provides useful energy demand for a metropolitan area by industry waste
   heat supply and transportation of energy through STA system. The optimum
   energy system with and without introducing STA system in the long-term
   energy planning is obtained. At the end, the effect on the pollution
   emission and fossil fuel based energy conservation is obtained. (C) 2004

Abstract = {This article evaluates energy efficiency in Brazilian crude oil refining
   in comparison with the crude oil refining in the United States between
   1930 and 2008. It aims to show that increased refinery complexity
   reduces the energy consumption of products of high value added.
   Moreover, the article shows that improvements in energy efficiency
   result in higher quality products and increased processing of oil. A
   Brazilian refinery with a capacity of 157,000 barrels per day (kbpd) was
   modernized in 2008 at a cost of US \$1.3 billion. As a result, its
   capacity increased by 17\%, from 157 to 189 kbpd. Its complexity index
   also rose from 3.2 to 6.8, allowing an improvement in the EII (energy
   intensity index) from 110\% to 93\%. In relation to the crude oil
   processed before being modernized, energy consumption fell from 0.75 to
   0.52 MBtu (million British thermal units) per barrel processed. These

Abstract = {A novel micro-needle array electrode (MAE) fabricated by thermal drawing

   simple and effective setup was employed to form glassy-state poly

   thermal drawing method. The MA was composed of 6 x 6 micro-needles with
   an average height of about 500 mu m. Electrode-skin interface impedance
   (EII) was recorded as the insertion force was applied on the MAE. The
   insertion process of the MAE was also simulated by the finite element
   method. Results showed that MAE could insert into skin with a relatively
   low compression force and maintain stable contact impedance between the
   MAE and skin. Bio-signals, including electromyography (EMG),
   electrocardiography (ECG), and electroencephalograph (EEG) were also
   collected. Test results showed that the MAE could record EMG, ECG, and
   EEG signals with good fidelity in shape and amplitude in comparison with
   the commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes, which proves that MAE is an

Abstract = {Germany's economy is the fourth-largest economy behind the US, China,
   and Japan, with a strong industrial base and many energy-intensive
   industries. Germany has been and continues to be a significant emitter
   of greenhouse gases (GHG). Germany has also taken on a leadership role
   in supporting emission reductions internationally, e.g., within the
   UNFCCC framework and the European Union (EU), which plays a significant
   role both internationally and domestically. Germany's political
   intentions and ambitious political goals rested on a somewhat fragmented
   and relatively thin legal foundation. This changed towards the end of
   2019 with the passage of the Federal Climate Change Act (FCCA), which
   entered into force in December 2019. This framework act spells out the
   long-term goal of GHG-neutrality by 2050 and a 55\% GHG reduction target
   by 2030. The FCAA must be read in conjunction with the Climate Action
   Plan 2050 and the Climate Protection Program 2030, which can be regarded
   as planning tools. Additional challenges arise from the fact that
   Germany has decided to phase out coal as a fuel for energy generation
   over the coming two decades and to take all existing nuclear power
   plants off the grid in the very short term. The paper attempts to
   explain and critically analyze Germany's legal and political framework
   dealing with climate change with an emphasis on the difficulties of very
   long-term policy planning in the volatile political and economic
   environment with often competing interests.},

Abstract = {This paper explains a methodology for a low-cost air pollution emissions
   inventory, focusing on fuel combustion processes in industries and based
   on the identification and refinement of connections among existing
   databases. The first bottom-up approach allowed by the HORUS model is
   especially suitable for developing countries, where there are limited
   resources for air emission monitoring. It starts from adapting and
   connecting databases and statistics, providing a top-down inventory that
   establishes the boundaries for the bottom-up assessment. The latter is
   based on a proxy distribution of the numbers of employees in each
   industry for each sector. Some results are presented for the case of the
   State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with three different fuels submitted to
   three main combustion processes, producing three pollutants under two
   scenarios (plus carbon dioxide). From a universe of 157,304 industries,
   the model covered 46,283 (up to 54\% of total fuel consumption). With a
   high spatial and temporal resolution, the model is extremely flexible
   and transparent, an approach that can be adapted to other regions in the
   world. This is particularly important in developing countries, with
   energy intensive industries and severe episodes of urban air pollution.
   Further developments can refine the model, by substituting the
   calculated outputs by real scale measurements or by providing upgrades
   in the available statistical databases, demonstrating the value of such
   a tool for an integrated energy and environmental planning. (C) 2004

Title = {A Decomposition Analysis of the Korean Manufacturing Sector: Monetary
   vs. Physical Outputs},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study analyzes the changes in energy consumption of the Korean
   manufacturing sector using the index decomposition analysis (IDA)
   method. To capture the production effect based on actual physical
   activities, we applied the activity revaluation (AR) approach in the
   analysis. We also developed energy consumption data in terms of primary
   energy supply to consider conversion loss in the energy sector to avoid
   any distortions in the intensity effect. The analysis covers every
   manufacturing subsector in Korea over the period between 2006 and 2018.
   Combining two distinctive approaches from the previous literature, the
   AR approach and primary energy-based analysis gives us helpful findings
   for a climate policy. First, the overall activity effect estimated from
   the physical output indicator is lower than that from the monetary
   output indicator. The monetary indicator shows that the share of
   energy-intensive industries decreases, whereas the physical indicator
   shows the opposite. Second, in terms of energy efficiency, the intensity
   effect is estimated as an increasing factor of energy use, whereas
   inversed results are shown when we use the monetary indicator. Lastly,
   unlike the previous studies, the AR approach results indicate that
   Korean manufacturing sectors have been shifting toward an
   energy-intensive, so it is hard to anticipate positive intensity
   effects, which means decreasing energy consumption factor, for a while.
   These results support why analyzing the driving forces of energy
   consumption through the AR approach and primary energy base is highly
   recommended.},

Title = {Shades of green energy: Geographies of small hydropower in Yunnan, China

Abstract = {Small hydropower (SHP) has a global reputation as a `green', low-carbon
   energy source that improves rural livelihoods and contributes to local
   economic development. In China, SHP has grown rapidly since the early
   2000s, particularly in the water-rich provinces in the country's
   southwest. However, because SHP plants in China are privately-operated
   and approved by local governments, there is an incentive to construct
   large, multiple cascade systems to generate as much power as possible.
   In many areas, this has led to over-development of SHP and associated
   negative environmental and social impacts. In this paper, we identify
   the factors that shape geographies of SHP over-development, what we
   refer to as `shades' of green energy. We then analyze the direct and
   indirect impacts of over-development. We draw on interviews and
   electricity generation data from six prefectures in Yunnan province, one
   of the world's largest hydropower producing regions. We find that
   prefectures that operate in a semi-autonomous way in electricity
   management and industrial planning are most prone to over-develop SHP,
   since they depend on hydropower revenues from electricity generation and
   local energy-intensive industries. We also find that over-development of
   SHP causes streamflow reductions and unstable electricity generation,
   and in some areas, drives an increase in environmentally-destructive
   mineral processing and reduces irrigation water access. These findings
   suggest a need for coordinated river basin planning on small watersheds
   and a reassessment of the role of SHP in local economic development.},

Abstract = {Multi-position refining furnaces are a critical strategy for
   energy-intensive industries to meet its demands of fast-paced
   production. In most literature, however, they serve only as a buffer,
   holding up to at most two ladles to maintain the proper temperature of
   ladles. These studies do not take full advantage of them, nor do they
   study the production scheduling of energy-intensive enterprises with
   multi-position refining furnaces under time-of-use (TOU) tariffs.
   Therefore, this paper presents a steelmaking-continuous casting (SCC)
   scheduling problem with multi-position refining furnaces under TOU
   tariffs. We firstly develop a mixed integer nonlinear programming
   (MINLP) model with the goals of minimizing jobs completion time,
   machines idle time, and total electricity costs, which subjects to the
   double-position characteristics and other process constraints. Owing to
   the complexity between the time-slots of TOU tariffs and the processing
   cycles of jobs, we design an intermediate function to calculate
   objectives efficiently. Furthermore, a Lagrangian relaxation (LR)
   algorithm based on a subgradient algorithm is utilized to solve the
   proposed model, and an interior point algorithm is adopted to solve
   sub-problems obtained by job-level and batch-level decomposition, whose
   solution approximates optimality comparing to GUROBI solver. The
   computational results demonstrate that the solution of job-level
   decomposition algorithm approximates the optimal scheduling scheme in an
   acceptable time and is superior to that of GUROBI solver. In addition,
   double-position instance can find a better scheduling scheme than
   nondouble-position one.},

   Efficiency Based on a Greenhouse Evolutionary Ventilation Algorithm
   Fuzzy-Model},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The combination and convergence of energy-intensive industries developed
   by ecological factors based on energy clusters is discussed in this
   paper. Here, a few models for the prediction of greenhouse effects are
   used as a single type of modeling. In this model, the solar panel system
   is included as a measure of the greenhouse effect; Commitment Unit (CU)
   formulations are changed with flouted logic because solar integrations
   and other unknown variables are intermittent. In general, the greenhouse
   model with natural ventilation temperature prediction is incomplete, in
   which the resulting fluid logical CU problem can be solved with an
   evolutionary algorithm based on the definition and the theory of quantum
   calculation. This paper proposes a Fuzzy Model-Based Quantum Greenhouse
   Evolutionary Ventilation Algorithm (FM-BSQGEVA) which helps to minimize
   the CU problem. The QGEVA is updated to include a
   hierarchy-group-oriented scheme to tackle the non-linear nature of the
   issue and its multifaceted nature. The QGEVA is further developed to
   support a new binary differential operator and several genetic algorithm
   operators with a redefined rotational angle look-up. The chances that
   such operators are used on separate solutions are affected by stating
   the membership function based on their related fitness. The fitness
   function is calculated through a combination of the penalty function,
   objective function and the added fluid function. The models built can be
   used to regulate and control natural ventilation in greenhouse effects.
   This finding shows that an energy-intensive industrial cluster's
   environmental chain of the industry has improved eco-efficiency.},

Abstract = {The Emission Trading System has been promoted as a tool for providing
   financial and cost-effective incentives to carbon emitters to apply
   emission reduction measures. The mechanism of Emission Trading System
   has been applied in many energy-intensive industries such as electric
   power industry. However, it appears that Emission Trading System finds
   limited application in building sector due to the unique characteristics
   of buildings. This study presents an identification and analysis on the
   factors affecting the implementation of Emission Trading System in the
   building sector within the context of China. Research data are collected
   from semi-structured interviews with a group of carefully selected
   experts. As a result, fifteen representative factors have been
   identified, and discussions on their representativeness have been
   conducted. The intricate interrelationships between the identified
   factors have been examined based on a hierarchy structure established by
   using the Interpretive Structural Modeling method. Furthermore, these
   factors have been classified into four categories: autonomous factors,
   dependent factors, linkage factors, and driving factors, which is based
   on the calculation of the factors' driving/dependence power by applying
   the Matrice d'Impacts croises-multipication applique a classement
   (MICMAC) technique. This classification provides a different profile
   between individual factors from that by traditional study where the
   relative importance is generally given between factors. The findings on

Abstract = {Production planning and control pursues high delivery reliability and
   short delivery time of the production system at the lowest possible
   costs. Especially in energy-intensive industries, energy cost account
   for a significant amount of manufacturing costs. The consideration of
   variable electricity market prices using energy-flexibility measures
   facilitates reduced costs by adapting the load profile of production to
   an electricity price forecast. However, it also increases the production
   planning and control system's complexity by additional input variables
   and possible risks due to the influence of flexibility measures on the
   production system. In the case of unexpected events, such as failure of
   machines or faulty materials, it is difficult to adapt the complex
   production system to the new situation quickly. There is a risk of high
   additional costs by various causes, such as delays in deadlines or load
   peaks. Therefore, this paper presents an approach for developing and
   evaluating risk treatment paths, which include possible combinations of
   risks and measures for the mitigation of risk effects. The advantage of
   these paths compared to a situational reaction is that all effects and
   possible further interactions can be considered and thus overall
   cost-efficient solutions can be found. The approach is based on the
   determination of interactions through interpretive structural modelling
   and the calculation of conditional probabilities using Bayesian
   Networks. The approach was implemented in MATLAB(R) and applied using
   real order and energy data from a foundry. The results show that the
   presented approach enables structured and data-based comparison of risk
   treatment paths.},

   with the total tardiness constraint},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {226},
Pages = {515-525},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Recent years have seen a great deal of attention in energy conservation
   for production and manufacturing activities, particularly for
   energy-intensive industries. One of the useful strategies in reducing
   unnecessary energy consumption is to schedule these activities by
   considering both energy driven and time-oriented criteria. This
   scheduling model can make an interaction between the energy consumption
   and the production cost to realize an efficient and sustainable
   production process. In this regard, the customers' expectation for due
   date is another important factor for decision-makers to control the
   delay in delivery. Making these decisions is extremely difficult due to
   uncertain circumstances to extract the accurate information of
   facilities and jobs in advance. Aforementioned issues in the context of
   urgent need for energy-conservation as well as the advent of globalized
   and multi-factory manufacture motivate our attempts to address a
   stochastic multi-objective distributed permutation flow shop scheduling
   problem by considering total tardiness constraint via minimizing the
   makespan and the total energy consumption. Due to the uncertainty of the
   proposed problem, a chance-constrain approach is used to describe
   decision-makers' awareness for the total tardiness, and accordingly, a
   chance-constrained programming model is utilized to formulate this
   problem. As a complicated optimization problem, a new multi-objective
   brain storm optimization algorithm incorporating stochastic simulation
   approach is specifically designed to better solve problem. A comparative
   study based on a set of benchmark test problems as well as two classical
   and popular algorithms is provided. The experimental results demonstrate
   that the proposed algorithm shows a very competitive performance in
   dealing with the investigated problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper describes a hierarchical production planning approach with
   decision support features for energy intensive industries with
   particular reference to a tile manufacturing factory. In the tiling
   industry, the facilities which contribute most to the consumption of
   energy (and, hence, to the production costs) are usually the kilns where
   the curing operation is carried out. Frequently, the kilns are also the
   bottleneck in terms of capacity utilization. Thus, in order to save on
   energy costs, a planning approach which aims at minimizing the number of
   active kilns throughout the year is needed besides optimizing the
   process design in the curing department. To achieve the latter goal, it
   is necessary to take into account demand fluctuations as well as
   detailed capacity restrictions while deciding on the lot sizes of the
   products and the kilns on which the products are loaded. Rather than
   adopting a monolithic mathematical model for developing a desirable
   production plan, a hierarchical approach which decomposes the problem
   into two sub-problems is preferred. In the first level, products and
   capacity are aggregated over the planning horizon to achieve an overall
   consideration of demand fluctuations over time. Then, the solution
   provided by the aggregate solution for the current planning period is
   disaggregated into a detailed lot sizing and loading solution. The
   disaggregated problem is difficult to solve and hence, a heuristic is
   proposed here. This planning approach is sustained by a Decision Support
   System which enables the elimination of possible inconsistencies in the
   production plan by providing an effective interaction with the decision
   maker. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Peaking Industrial CO2 Emission in a Typical Heavy Industrial Region:
   From Multi-Industry and Multi-Energy Type Perspectives},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Peaking industrial carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is critical for China
   to achieve its CO2 peaking target by 2030 since industrial sector is a
   major contributor to CO2 emissions. Heavy industrial regions consume
   plenty of fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2 emissions, which
   also have huge CO2 emissions reduction potential. It is significant to
   accurately forecast CO2 emission peak of industrial sector in heavy
   industrial regions from multi-industry and multi-energy type
   perspectives. This study incorporates 41 industries and 16 types of
   energy into the Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP)
   model to predict the CO2 emission peak of the industrial sector in Jilin
   Province, a typical heavy industrial region. Four scenarios including
   business-as-usual scenario (BAU), energy-saving scenario (ESS),
   energy-saving and low-carbon scenario (ELS) and low-carbon scenario
   (LCS) are set for simulating the future CO2 emission trends during
   2018-2050. The method of variable control is utilized to explore the
   degree and the direction of influencing factors of CO2 emission in four
   scenarios. The results indicate that the peak value of CO2 emission in
   the four scenarios are 165.65 million tons (Mt), 156.80 Mt, 128.16 Mt,
   and 114.17 Mt in 2040, 2040, 2030 and 2020, respectively. Taking ELS as
   an example, the larger energy-intensive industries such as ferrous metal
   smelting will peak CO2 emission in 2025, and low energy industries such
   as automobile manufacturing will continue to develop rapidly. The
   influence degree of the four factors is as follows: industrial added
   value (1.27) > industrial structure (1.19) > energy intensity of each
   industry (1.12) > energy consumption types of each industry (1.02).
   Among the four factors, industrial value added is a positive factor for
   CO2 emission, and the rest are inhibitory ones. The study provides a
   reference for developing industrial CO2 emission reduction policies from
   multi-industry and multi-energy type perspectives in heavy industrial
   regions of developing countries.},

Title = {Examining the relationships between carbon emissions and land supply in
   China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {China's CO2 reduction is crucial in mitigating global and regional
   climate change. Land resources used by industrial enterprises in China
   come from official land transactions, which indirectly affects carbon
   emissions. The quantitative examination of the relationship between land
   supply and carbon emissions can provide potential pathways and
   strategies for regional carbon emission reduction. For this purpose, we
   innovatively integrated land transaction data from China's industrial
   enterprise and carbon emission databases. Using this integrated
   database, we estimated the carbon emission changes from land
   transactions from 2006 to 2013, focusing on the transformation of
   agricultural land into industrial land in China's 331 cities. The
   results showed that land transactions could cause high carbon emissions
   in China. The industry with the largest land transaction area during the
   study period was the production and supply of electric power, steam, and
   hot water, and the one with the highest increase in carbon emissions
   from land transactions was the smelting and pressing of ferrous metals.
   By further examining the typology of the relationships between land
   transactions and carbon emissions for these cities, a scientific
   reference for pathways for reducing carbon emissions in cities was
   generated. Specifically, the results showed that cities with high land
   supply and carbon emissions were mainly resource-based or economic
   priority cities for development. For these cities, the entry threshold
   of energy-intensive industries must be raised, and the supply of land
   for clean energy enterprises should be increased. In contrast, cities
   with low land supply but high emissions primarily had depleting
   resources, high ecological and environmental pressure, and relatively
   lagging economic development. Correspondingly, the government should use
   the land supply to guide industries to reduce their dependence on
   traditional fossil energy. Regardless of the type of city in terms of
   relationships between carbon emissions and land transactions, indicators
   of carbon emission intensity should be included and carefully considered
   in land use planning and land transaction processes in the future.},

Title = {The dynamic effects of international oil price shocks on economic
   fluctuation},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper mainly focuses on the dynamic effects of oil price shocks on
   macroeconomics and different industries. Specifically, we examine the
   corresponding dynamic influence mechanism, as well as analyzing the
   sources of structural shocks that drive oil price fluctuations. Since
   the oil prices fluctuation generates endogenous effects on the
   macroeconomic dynamics, it is appropriate to use the shocks of oil price
   fluctuations as structural shocks. Then the structural vector
   autoregressive (SVAR) model is employed for analysis. And we utilize the
   Bayesian estimation method that fully recognizes prior information to
   estimate the SVAR model, with which the impact of structural shocks that
   cause international oil price fluctuations are examined. Further, the
   influences and impact mechanism of oil supply shocks, specific demand
   shocks, and aggregate demand shocks on Chinese industry economies are
   examined. Empirical studies have found that the influence of oil supply
   has caused reduction in oil production. In the short term, the shocks of
   oil supply and specific demand in the oil market lead to rising oil
   prices, thus curbing economic output. The rise of oil prices caused by
   aggregate demand shocks will expand economic output. The shock of
   aggregate economic demand acts as the main source of oil price shocks,
   and the specific demand of the oil market generates more restraining
   effects on economic output than that of oil supply and aggregate demand.
   Seen from the heterogeneity of light and heavy industries,
   energy-intensive industries are less affected by the supply and demand
   shocks than other industries due to the impact of government subsidies
   and the state-owned enterprise equity system. The impact of specific
   demand shocks of oil prices on industrial output is higher than that of
   supply shocks and demand shocks. The conclusion provides reference for
   adopting strategies to cope with oil prices fluctuation from the
   perspective of national security, so as to establish diversified oil
   reserve system, avoiding risks in the energy derivatives market.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Impervious Surface Expansion in the Qinhuai
   River Basin, China, 1988-2017},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Impervious surfaces are key indicators for urbanization monitoring and
   watershed degradation assessment over space and time. However, most
   empirical studies only extracted impervious surface from spatial,
   temporal or spectral perspectives, paying less attention to integrating
   multiple dimensions in acquiring continuous changes in impervious
   surfaces. In this study, we proposed a neighborhood-based
   spatio-temporal filter (NSTF) to obtain the continuous change
   information of impervious surfaces from multi-temporal Landsat images in
   the Qinhuai River Basin (QRB), Jiangsu, China from 1988-2017, based on
   the results from semi-automatic decision tree classification. Moreover,
   we used the expansion intensity index (EII) and the landscape extension
   index (LEI) to further characterize the spatio-temporal characteristics
   of impervious surfaces on different spatial scales. The preliminary
   results showed that the overall accuracies of the final classification
   were about 95\%, with the kappa coefficients ranging between 0.9 and
   0.96. The QRB underwent rapid urbanization with the percentage of the
   impervious surfaces increasing from 2.72\% in 1988 to 25.6\% in 2017.
   Since 2006, the center of urbanization expansion was shaped from the
   urban built-up areas of Nanjing and Jiangning to non-urban built-up
   areas of the Jiangning, Lishui, and Jurong districts. The edge expansion
   occupied 73\% on average among the different landscape expansion types,
   greatly beyond outlying (12\%) and infilling (15\%). The window size in
   the NSTF has a direct impact on the subsequent analysis. Our research
   could provide decision-making references for future urban planning and
   development in the similar basins.},

Title = {Analysis of the influence of the current-voltage characteristics of the
   voltage rectifiers on the static characteristics of hydrogen
   electrolyzer load},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Traditionally, the determination of static load characteristics is one
   of the main stages in the preparation of a design model of an electric
   power system. It is especially important to correctly take into account
   energy-intensive industries, which make a huge contribution to the
   formation of these characteristics. In particular, the increased
   interest in hydrogen technologies observed in the world as one of the
   most promising high-tech areas of energy development, and an increase in
   the share of the installed capacity of generation units based on
   renewable energy sources determine the prospects for the development of
   hydrogen production by water electrolysis. Accordingly, a significant
   increase in the scale of application of hydrogen technologies, in
   particular, in accordance with the ``Hydrogen Strategy for Climatically
   Neutral Europe{''}, the European Commission for the production of
   ``green{''} hydrogen, determines the task of forming correct
   mathematical models of these devices in terms planning of modes,
   analyzing their impact on the parameters of electric power systems.
   Determination of static load characteristics on the basis of a physical
   experiment will not allow obtaining a characteristic with a significant
   increase or decrease in voltage in the node of the electric power
   system, which occur only in emergency modes of operation of the power
   system. Therefore, it seems relevant to analyze and determine the
   electrical characteristics of consumers by mathematical modeling of the
   power circuit. This article presents the results of correcting the
   static load characteristic of a high-power electrolyzer used in the
   production of hydrogen. The analysis of these results obtained with the
   MATLAB software is carried out using least squares regression to procure
   polynomial functions of the static load characteristics. According to
   this analysis, the static characteristics of the considered
   electrolyzer, being close to linear within the control range, outside
   the control range acquire parabolic dependences of active and reactive
   power on voltage. The static load characteristics of the installation
   are determined by the parameters of the power circuit and the
   current-voltage characteristic of the rectifiers displacing the vertices
   of the parabolas from the origin, which should be taken into account to
   increase the reliability of the design scheme. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {During the Twelve Five period, China promulgated industrial policies
   promote the energy-intensive industries relocate to coastal areas in
   order to utilize marine shipping resources. Consequently, some major
   state-owned steel and petrochemical enterprises have relocated and
   resulted in a large scale coastal area development. Restricted by the
   port construction, most of the coastal industrial areas are located in
   the outer suburbs. To balance between employment and housing, new
   industrial coastal towns were constructed. In this paper, we adopt a
   case-study approach to analysis some typical industrial coastal towns of
   Liaoning Province situated in the Bohai Bay, which is currently under
   rapid economic growth. Our investigations reflect the common phenomenon
   of long distance commuting and massive amount of vacant residences. More
   specifically, large plant relocation caused hundreds of kilometers of
   daily commute and enterprises had to provide housing subsidies and
   education incentives to motivate employees to relocate to coastal areas.
   Nonetheless, many employees still refuse to relocate due to job
   stability, diverse needs of family members and access to convenient
   services. These employees averaged 4 hours of commute daily and some who
   lived further had to reside in temporary industrial housing units and
   subject to long-term family separation. As a result, only a small
   portion of employees purchase new coastal residences but mostly for
   investment and retirement purposes, leading to massive vacancy and
   ghost-town phenomenon. In contrast to the low demand, coastal areas tend
   to develop large amount of residences prior to industrial relocation,
   which may be directly related to local government finances. Some local
   governments have sold residential land to developers to general revenue
   to support the subsequent industrial development. Subject to the strong
   preference of ocean-view, residential housing developers tend to select
   coast-line land to construct new residential towns, which further
   reduces the access of marine resources for major industrial enterprises.
   This violates the original intent of developing industrial coastal towns
   and drastically limits the availability of marine resources. Lastly, we
   analyze the co-existence of over-exploiting residential areas and
   massive vacancies in reference to the demand and supply of land, as well
   as the demand of residential housing units with the choice criteria of
   enterprise employees.},

Abstract = {Energy consumption and its impact on the efficiency and environmental
   issues has become of great importance recently. Sugar is the main energy
   consumer among food product industry and has an old technology. Sugar
   production has been one of the most energy intensive industries in Iran
   during recent years since its technological infrastructure is poor and
   needs to be promoted. Energy intensity and the amount of energy
   consumption of sugar factories have a critical situation. Sugar
   factories can be categorized as three sections depend on different
   available raw materials such as beet, cane, and raw sugar. This industry
   is the 2d oldest industry in country that produces 1250000 ton sugar in
   2003. Energy intensity of Iranian factories is 27 GJ/ton while this
   index is 19.27 GJ/ton for the average of the world and 11 GJ/ton for
   developed countries. Comparing the average energy intensity of sugar
   industry in Iran with the world data, there are 42\% saving potential
   for factories that consume beet as raw material, 6\% saving for cane,
   and 63\% for raw sugar in 2002. This study, based on conducting on-site
   energy audits Of 36 factories in Iran during 2001-2004, discovered 2570
   terra J/year energy-saving potentials. The main reasons for this gap
   management problems, old machinery, and old production technology and
   cane \& beet sugar content. In addition there is a large gap in raw
   sugar refineries between Iran and other countries.
   As a result of monitoring manufacturing units in the country, the
   following significant results achieved for policy makers: supporting of
   establishment the new higher efficient units, planning conversion the
   traditional units into industrial ones, introducing new standards and
   developing much richer sugar content of consuming raw material in
   producing plants. This paper discusses the present situation of sugar
   industry from the technological point of view and related indexes, the
   possible solutions to the industry, possible policies in terms of its
   current technologies and available standards, the impact of policies in
   the whole industry situation and the role of policy makers. Saving
   options have been economically and technologically evaluated and
   compared.},

Title = {Comparative genomic analysis of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus
   pneumoniae isolates},
Journal = {INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {659-670},
Abstract = {Introduction: Multidrug resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae has
   emerged as a serious problem to public health. A further understanding
   of the genetic diversity in antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates
   is needed.
   Methods: We conducted whole-genome resequencing for 25 pneumococcal
   strains isolated from children with different antimicrobial resistance
   profiles. Comparative analysis focus on detection of single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (indels) was
   conducted. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis was applied to investigate
   the genetic relationship among these strains.
   Results: The genome size of the isolates was similar to 2.1 Mbp,
   covering >90\% of the total estimated size of the reference genome. The
   overall G+C\% content was similar to 39.5\%, and there were 2,200-2,400
   open reading frames. All isolates with different drug resistance
   profiles harbored many indels (range 131-171) and SNPs (range
   16,103-28,128). Genetic diversity analysis showed that the variation of
   different genes were associated with specific antibiotic resistance.
   Known antibiotic resistance genes (pbps, murMN, ciaH, rplD, sulA, and
   dpr) were identified, and new genes (regR, argH, trkH, and PTS-EII)
   closely related with antibiotic resistance were found, although these
   genes were primarily annotated with functions in virulence as well as
   carbohydrate and amino acid transport and metabolism. Phylogenetic
   analysis unambiguously indicated that isolates with different antibiotic
   resistance profiles harbored similar genetic backgrounds. One isolate,
   14-LC.ER1025, showed a much weaker phylogenetic relationship with the
   other isolates, possibly caused by genomic variation.
   Conclusion: In this study, although pneumococcal isolates had similar
   genetic backgrounds, strains were diverse at the genomic level. These
   strains exhibited distinct variations in their indel and SNP
   compositions associated with drug resistance.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {It is necessary to understand the relationship between the impervious
   surface area (ISA) distribution, variation trends and potential driving
   forces over Dongying, Shandong Province. We extracted ISA information
   from Landsat images with 3-5 year intervals during 1995 to 2018 using
   Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transform, Pixel Purity Index (PPI), and
   Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis (LSMA), followed by the analysis on
   three driving forces of ISA expansion (physical geography, socioeconomic
   factors, and urban cultural features). Our results show the retrieved
   ISA thematic map fit the limited requirement of root mean square error
   (RMSE). The correct classification accuracy of ISA is greater than
   83.08\%. Further, the cross-comparison exhibits the general consistent
   with the ISA distribution of the land use classification map published
   by the National Basic Geographic Information Center. The gradual
   increasing trend can be captured on the expansion of ISA from 1995 to
   2018. Despite of the central region always shown as the high ISA
   density, it still keeps increasing annually and radiating the
   surrounding region, especially in the southward which has formed into a
   new large-scale and high intensity of ISA in 2015-2018. Though the ISA
   patches scattered in the west region or along the northern and eastern
   part of the ocean coastline are still small, the expansion trend of ISA
   can be detected. The expansion intensity index (EII) of ISA measuring
   the situation of its expansion changes from the lowest value 0.12\%
   between 1995 and 2000 up to the highest 0.73\% between 2000 and 2005.
   Richly endowed by nature, the city's natural geographical environment
   provides an elevated chance of further urbanization. The rapid increase
   of regional economy provides a fundamental driving force for expanding
   ISAs. The development of urban culture promotes the sustainable
   development of ISAs. Our results provide a scientific basis for future
   urban land use management, construction planning, and environmental
   protection in Dongying.},

Title = {How to achieve low/no-fossil carbon transformations: With a special
   focus upon mechanisms, technologies and policies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {163},
Pages = {15-23},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Climate change, environmental problems and consequent ecological damages
   due to excessive consumption of resources and to the continuing human
   population growth of more than 80,000,000 net increase per year, have
   damaged and continue to accelerate the devastation of numerous
   ecosystems. These changes have brought significant harm to humans and
   are imposing high costs on societal maintenance and development. In that
   context, low/no-fossil carbon transformations and improved material's
   and energy efficiency are crucial elements for reconciling human
   activities with sustainable societal development, which is built upon
   vibrant and sustainable ecosystems. The urgently needed changes are
   bound to be difficult to make due to the perceived contradictions
   between low/no-fossil-carbon systems and sustainable and economically
   vibrant societies. This Special Volume (SV) is comprised of thirty-three
   articles, which mainly focus on investigations of low/no-fossil carbon
   transformations in countries, regions, industries and enterprises. Some
   authors provided insights of ways to proceed based upon new research and
   development (R\&D), evaluations of specific low/no-fossil carbon
   technologies and lessons learned from policy simulations and analyses of
   potential post-fossil carbon societies. This SV introductory article
   contains an overview of the content of the articles divided into five
   topics: (a) low/no-fossil carbon transformations within industrial
   sectors, (b) regional planning and low/no-fossil carbon developments,
   (c) multi-regional, low/no-fossil carbon economies, (d) specific
   low-fossil carbon technologies, and (e) low/no-fossil carbon policy
   results. Given the extensive coverage of low/no-fossil carbon
   transformations, the papers on mechanisms and pathways are clearly the
   most important contributions of this SV. The researchers focused broadly
   on ways to address two objectives: (a) To characterize the main factors
   catalyzing high-fossil carbon development and (b) To accelerate the
   transition to low/no fossil carbon societies. Some authors focused upon
   new, low/no-fossil carbon development and planning in different
   countries and regions, while others focused upon ways to make changes
   within energy-intensive industries. Additionally, some authors reported
   on progress in the evaluation of the effectiveness of specific
   low/no-fossil-carbon technologies and in the design and implementation
   of low/no-fossil carbon policies. The findings and recommendations of
   the authors are positive and encouraging. However, it is clear, that
   there are many additional research, policy and educational challenges,
   which must be solved, to establish and support systems to guide and to
   monitor the transformations to sustainable, equitable, livable,
   low/post-fossil carbon societies. Much work remains but the wisdom in
   the articles in this SV will help societies make the needed transitions.

Abstract = {The transition to a non-emitting energy mix for power generation will
   take decades. This transition will need to be sustainable, e.g.
   economically affordable. Fossil fuels which are abundant have an
   important role to play in this respect, provided that Carbon Capture and
   Storage (CCS) is progressively implemented. CCS is the only way to
   reduce emissions from energy intensive industries.
   Thus, the need for upgraded and new CCS research facilities is widely
   recognised among stakeholders across Europe, as emphasised by the Zero
   Emissions Platform (ZEP) {[}1] and the European Energy Research Alliance
   on CCS (EERA-CCS) {[}2].
   The European Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Laboratory
   Infrastructure, ECCSEL, provides funders, operators and researchers with
   significant benefits by offering access to world-class research
   facilities that, in many cases, are unlikely for a single nation to
   support in isolation. This implies creation of synergy and the avoidance
   of duplication as well as streamlining of funding for research
   facilities.
   ECCSEL offers open access to its advanced laboratories for talented
   scientists and visiting researchers to conduct cutting-edge research.
   In the planning of ECCSEL, gap analyses were performed and CCS
   technologies have been reviewed to underpin and envisage the future
   experimental setup; 1) Making use of readily available facilities, 2)
   Modifying existing facilities, and 3) Planning and building entirely new
   advanced facilities.
   The investments required for the first ten years (2015-2025) are
   expected to be in the range of (sic)80-120 million. These investments
   show the current level of ambition, as proposed during the preparatory
   phase (2011-2014).
   Entering the implementation phase in 2015, 9 European countries signed
   Letter of Intent (Lol) to join a ECCSEL legal entity: France, United
   Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Poland, Greece, Norway and
   Switzerland (active observer). As the EU ERIC-regulation {[}3] would
   offer the most suitable legal framework for ECCSEL, the host country,
   Norway, will apply for establishing ERIC as the ECCSEL Research
   Infrastructure (RI) legal entity in 2017. Until the ECCSEL ERIC is
   approved by the European Commission (probably by summer 2017), an
   interim MoU agreement for the implementation phase of ECCSEL RI has been
   signed by 13 research institutions and universities representing the 9
   countries. A consortium of these partners were granted 3 million EURO
   from Horizon 2020 to boost implementation of ECCSEL from September 2015
   and two years onwards. (C) 2016, Institute of Process Engineering,

Title = {Quantifying emotional differences in urban green spaces extracted from

   in northern China},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {In rapid urbanization processes, the high density and fast rhythm of the
   urban living environment lead to mental tension, life pressure, anxiety,
   and other problems for people, which facilitates negative emotions.
   Studies have confirmed that an urban green space is a ``restorative
   environment{''} that can effectively alleviate negative emotions and
   improve moods. Social media data can be objectively quantified to
   evaluate people's emotional responses to urban green spaces. Based on
   the analysis of social media data, this study examines whether there are
   differences in emotions linked to locations, with the data extracted
   from microblogs similar to Twitter in three different cities. Seven
   emotions (happiness, fear, surprise, anger, disgust, neutral, and
   sadness) were identified using online cognitive services on photos
   collected from microblog data. Three emotion-based indexes (emotion
   intensity index, emotion intensity index, emotion evenness index) were
   used to expand the urban green space pair from the spatial perspective
   of research on the influence of emotion. The results show that there are
   significant correlations among age, gender, emotional diversity, area,
   accessibility, NDVI, and emotion. The results also show that (1) the
   higher the NDVI of urban green space, the greater the probability and
   intensity of emotion in green space, and the more happiness emotion
   people show. (2) there is a significant positive correlation between
   urban green space area and EEI, and a significant negative correlation
   between urban green space area and EPI, EII, which is just opposite to
   the NDVI results. (3) Optimistic and positive emotions are widely
   expressed in cities, and happiness is expressed most and strongly. The
   negative emotions such as fear, anger, and trouble are less expressed,
   and the expressions of emotions in cities are highly similar. With the
   increase of age, happiness emotion increased, and sadness emotion
   decreased.These results show that the urban green space planning can be
   used to intervene in the expression of human emotion based on where a
   person lives. In the future, the planning and design of urban green
   spaces based on the reasonable balance and combinations of area,
   accessibility, and the NDVI can enhance the emotional enthusiasm for
   these areas. Improving the planning and design of the existing urban
   parks and green spaces with positive intervention methods can provide a
   feasible solution to meet the growing population's emotional recovery

   COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, SEP 10-11, 2001},
Organization = {Danish Energy Agcy, Energy Res Programme},
Abstract = {According to the agreed burden sharing within the European Union the
   overall EU emission reduction target as agreed by in the Kyoto protocol
   is converted into national greenhouse gas reduction-targets for each of
   the member states. In parallel with national emission reduction
   initiatives common EU policies for emission reductions are considered.
   Currently discussed is the introduction of a market for tradable permits
   for CO2-emissions to achieve emission reductions within the power
   industry and other energy intensive industries. In parallel with this
   markets for green certificates to deploy renewable energy technologies
   seem to be appearing in a number of countries, among these Denmark,
   Italy, Sweden, Belgium (Flanders), England and Australia. Although these
   national initiatives for a green certificate market are fairly
   different, they could be a starting point for establishing a common EU
   certificate market. But interactions between national targets for
   greenhouse gas emissions and these international instruments for
   emission reduction are not a trivial matter, especially not seen in
   relation to the possible contributions of these instruments in achieving
   national GHG-reduction targets.
   The paper is split into three parts all taking a liberalised power
   market as starting point: The first part discusses the consequences of a
   general deployment of renewable energy technologies, using planning
   initiatives or national promotion schemes (feed-in tariffs). In the
   second part an international green certificate market is introduced into
   the liberalised power market context, substituting other national
   promotion schemes. Finally, in the third part a combination of an
   international green certificate market (TGC) and an international
   emission-trading scheme for CO2 is analysed within the liberalised
   international power market set-up.
   The main conclusion is that neither the use of national renewable
   support schemes nor the introduction of a TGC-market into a liberalised
   power market can be recommended, if these initiatives efficiently are
   expected to contribute in achieving the national CO2-reduction targets.
   Countries most ambitious in implementing renewable energy technologies
   will only partly be gaining the CO2-reduction benefits themselves. The
   ambitious countries will support the less ambitious ones in achieving
   their GHG-reduction targets. Finally, in a TGC-market context the most
   ambitious countries to fulfil their TGC-quotas will have to buy
   certificates from the less ambitious ones, although this only
   contributes to fulfilling a national target for renewable development,
   not in reaching their national CO-reduction targets.
   However, a combination of an international tradable permits market and a
   green certificate market is seen to be efficient in contributing in
   achieving the national CO2-reduction targets if a close co-ordination of
   the two instruments is undertaken at least at the national level: When
   the green power production is increased, the tradable permits quota
   should be decreased correspondingly. Otherwise the expected
   CO2-reductions will not contribute by the full value in achieving the
   national targets for greenhouse gas reductions. Thus, if it is a
   prerequisite that renewable power contributes to achieving national
   GHG-reduction targets, then the combination of these two markets might
   be the right solution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Multiphase machines (MPMs) have become serious contenders in several
   applications, such as offshore wind energy and electric vehicles.
   Low-order current harmonics arise in actual drives due to converter and
   machine nonlinearities, thus producing losses and torque ripple. In
   comparison to threephase machines, in MPMs this effect is aggravated
   because of the existence of low-impedance subspaces. To cancel these
   harmonics, a multiple resonant controller (RC) (MRC) structure has
   recently been proposed for MPMs, which combines RCs and synchronous
   frames (SFs). The MRC scheme allows a significant computational saving
   in comparison to the multiple SF (MSF) strategy, which includes a
   proportional-integral controller in an SF per each harmonic. However,
   such MRC method is only suitable for MPMs with symmetrical winding
   arrangement (SWA), while asymmetrical winding arrangement (AWA) is also
   a common choice. In this paper, the MRC strategy is extended to MPMs
   with AWA. Different neutral configurations, whose effect on the harmonic
   mapping is more complicated than for SWAs and has hardly been studied so
   far, are considered. The optimum combinations of frequencies at which
   the RCs and the SFs should be tuned for AWAs are assessed. Simulation
   results are provided.},

Abstract = {The pilot carbon emission trading scheme in Guangdong Province (GD ETS)
   of China has fulfilled seven compliance periods, and its potential
   impact on regulated firms has drawn increasing attention. This article
   empirically investigated the impact of the ETS on firm behaviors and
   competitiveness (i.e., cost competitiveness and green competitiveness)
   by surveying all power firms in the GD ETS. Low-carbon management,
   carbon asset transactions, and energy saving and emission reduction
   technology were identified as firm behaviors. The relationships among
   the ETS, firm behaviors, and firm competitiveness were tested by using
   bootstrap multiple mediation analyses. The results showed that the GD
   ETS has a positive impact on firm behaviors. The three examined firm
   behaviors actually reflect the depth of firm participation in the ETS.
   The more the firm participates, the greater the mediating effects that
   the firm behaviors exert on firm competitiveness are. Both carbon asset
   transactions and energy saving and emission reduction technology have a
   mediating effect on the relationship between the GD ETS and cost
   competitiveness, while only the latter mediates the relationship between
   the GD ETS and green competitiveness. Implications for policy makers and
   firm operators were discussed.},

   This paper proposes a two-step stochastic approach to the robust

   possibility of reacting in the future once the uncertainty materializes.
   Each evaporator has different features (capacity, equipment, etc.) and
   the individual performance is affected by external factors and fouling
   effects. Moreover, a multi-objective analysis has been carried out to
   provide a decision support for the operator who must take the concrete
   decisions about load allocation and cleaning tasks along a time horizon.
   The problem has been solved by discretizing the time horizon and
   adapting the general-precedence method to deal with an unknown number of
   tasks. The nonlinear behavior of each plant is approximated by surrogate
   linear models obtained experimentally, providing thus solutions in
   acceptable time.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this research, a full rehabilitation study (retrofit) of an isolated
   villa in a Mediterranean climate was carried out in order to show how a
   retrofit of a building with a combination of simple passive and active
   strategies can improve the sustainability, energy efficiency and the
   thermal comfort. This is performed thanks to the design of a methodology
   of using a thermal simulation tool with experimental measurements based
   on a low-cost open source hardware platform in order to evaluate the
   energy saving measures and analyse the thermal comfort and energy
   savings. To accomplish this, a study of the housing needs is performed a
   priori to later design the different actions in the rehabilitation,
   using if possible, ecological materials in its development. Basically,
   walls and ceilings are insulated, three solar air collectors are
   included to heat the air ventilation and decrease the heating demand,
   and two pellet stoves are installed. Finally, the refurbished house is
   modeled and simulated in EnergyPlus and compared with the indoor air
   temperature and relative humidity measurements, made using an
   Open-Source Monitoring System (OSMS) developed for this research in
   Arduino, obtaining results with no significant differences without the
   need to calibrate the system. The results of thermal comfort, heating
   and cooling demand and heating energy consumption of the house before
   and after the renovation are compared providing a decrease in thermal
   demand of 66\% and a decrease in heating energy consumption of 50\% in
   the winter season, where 60\% of the energy consumed is contributed from
   renewable sources. In terms of thermal comfort, the comparison of the
   PPD and PMV values shows an improvement in the house in heating and
   cooling season.},

Abstract = {Industrial processes working with cogeneration utilities can coordinate
   their operation to take advantage of Demand Response programs to reduce
   their cost, while making the grid more stable and secure. Simplified
   steady-state and transition models are usually employed in a
   mathematical scheduling fashion to deal with this problem in process
   plants with small inertia. Here, however, we propose the use of a
   dynamic-integrated optimization approach that considers the dominant
   process dynamics jointly with the heat and power coupling in the
   cogeneration unit. The methodology meets the related European
   legislation and it has been tested in a simulated sugar factory that has
   a cogeneration system with connection to the external grid. The
   operation under two tariffs (TOU and Spanish Day-Ahead prices) was
   compared to the traditional policy of maximum production and fixed
   electricity prices, showing that a reduction of up to 5.41\% of the
   costs is possible for the considered case study. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) Challenge simulation platform helps
   planners and stakeholders understand and manage the complexity of MSP.
   In the interactive simulation, different data layers covering an entire

   Users can create scenarios for future uses of the marine space over a
   period of several decades. Changes in energy infrastructure, shipping,
   and the marine environment are then simulated, and the effects are
   visualized using indicators and heat maps. The platform is built with
   advanced game technology and uses aspects of role-play to create
   interactive sessions; it can thus be referred to as serious gaming. To
   calculate and visualize the effects of planning decisions on the marine
   ecology, we integrated the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) food web modeling
   approach into the platform. We demonstrate how EwE was connected to MSP,
   considering the range of constraints imposed by running scientific
   software in interactive serious gaming sessions while still providing
   cascading ecological feedback in response to planning actions. We
   explored the connection by adapting two published ecological models for
   use in MSP sessions. We conclude with lessons learned and identify

Abstract = {The up- and mid-stream of Huaihe River Basin is a complex system of
   reservoirs and river-ways. It is difficult for flood control and
   reservoir scheduling. It is ineffective to perform sequential
   computations for optimal scheduling of multi-reservoir due to the system
   complexity. In this paper, we implemented the multi-reservoir optimal
   scheduling algorithm in a Grid environment. Key components as multiple
   Protocols were developed within the layers of Grid architecture. The
   proposed Grid computing architecture provides an innovative design of
   multi-reservoir optimal scheduling system for increasing the accuracy of
   flood control and speedup of computing.},

Abstract = {The application of wireless sensor network in control systems can bring
   some advantages, such as the flexibility and the feasibility of network
   deployment at low costs. While it also raises some new challenges.
   First, the limited communication resources are shared by several control
   loops. Second, the wireless and multi-hop character of sensor network
   makes the resources scheduling more difficult. Thus, how to allocate the
   limited communication and computing resources effectively is an
   important problem. In this paper, this problem is formulated as ail
   optimal sampling frequency assignment problem, where the objective
   function is to maximize the effectiveness of control systems, subject to
   channel capacity constraints. Then an iterative distributed algorithm
   based on local buffer information is proposed, which has features of low
   computational complexity and well scalability. Finally, the simulation
   results show that the proposed solution can achieve the optimal quality
   of the control system in a distributed way. Meanwhile, it is capable of
   seeking the optimal point automatically when the network load changes.},

Abstract = {Many multi-process scheduling schemes have been developed to utilize
   system resources efficiently. In the previous researches, most of the
   scheduling schemes were focused on how to allocate computing resources
   efficiently. However, in the environment of wireless sensor networks,
   scheduling policy for power resources of mobile device is also essential
   as high power drain of mobile sensor device will lead to immediate
   non-functioning of device due to limited capacity of its battery, Sensor
   nodes can also be powered by rechargeable power resources such as solar
   cell or gravitation. In these cases, residual energy of rechargeable
   power resource is dynamic over time. This motivated us to design a
   scheduling policy based on rechargeable power resource for increasing
   the network life time and reducing the response time of service. In this
   paper, we present and evaluate six process scheduling schemes based on
   execution time and energy consumption of process.},

Abstract = {Metropolitan-Area Grid (MAG) normally deals with a more limited

   and smaller range resources, Therefore, in a MAG, resource scheduling is
   distinguished from other Grid. Current research on performance
   evaluation of resource scheduling in MAG is based on simulation
   techniques, which can only consider a limited range of scenarios. In
   this paper, we propose a centralized resource scheduling model in a MAG
   and give a formal framework via Stochastic Process Algebras (SPA) to
   deal with this problem. Within this framework, we model and analyze the
   performance of resource scheduling, allowing for a wide variety of job
   and data scheduling algorithms. Moreover, we can evaluate the combined
   effectiveness of job and data scheduling algorithms, rather than study
   them separately.},

Abstract = {Importance and need of grid process scheduling have been increased in

   scheduling policies that manage and schedule grid process, This paper
   reviews current scheduling policies and proposes an efficient scheduling
   model which is called the predictive process scheduling model. For
   efficient scheduling, this paper presents the processing time prediction
   algorithm to resolve problems of grid scheduling. The predictive process
   scheduling model predicts processing times of processors, allocates a
   job to a processor with minimum processing time, and minimizes overall
   system execution times. For performance evaluation, this paper measures
   turn-around time, job loss, throughput, and utilization. Empirical
   results show that the predictive process scheduling model operates with
   the less 69.5\% of turn-around time and the less 76.4\% of job loss and
   improves the more 119.6\% of throughput and the more 117.8\% of
   utilization than those of existing scheduling models such as random

Abstract = {This paper addresses the joint optimization model of production
   scheduling, work-in-process (WIP) inventory control and group preventive
   maintenance (PM) planning in a multi-machine system with
   multi-components. The objective is to obtain optimum production
   sequence, PM intervals and grouping of components, which minimize the
   total expected cost per unit time of the system. A new meta-heuristic
   named Jaya algorithm and two popular algorithms viz. simulated annealing
   (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are applied to optimize the
   objective function. Initially, the optimum group of components is
   obtained based on the integer multiples of individual PM intervals.
   Secondly, the job permutation sequence incorporating group PM intervals
   is identified with the largest order value (LOV) rule. The shift in
   optimum PM intervals is realized with an advanced-postpone balancing
   approach. Computational results reveal that the proposed integrated
   model along with group PM yields up to 25\% cost reductions when
   compared to the integrated model with individual maintenance as well as
   37\% savings while no integration is performed. Furthermore, the
   performance of algorithms is evaluated with large-sized problems. The
   obtained results show that Jaya and SA yielded comparable results,
   however, PSO is least productive. Thus, the proposed approach yields
   better economic performance and brings more improvised solutions as
   compared to the conventional methods of integrated scheduling and
   maintenance optimization problems.},

Abstract = {Twenty leading scientists in the field of marine conservation planning
   attended the first international workshop on conservation planning in
   the Mediterranean Sea. This globally significant biodiversity hotspot
   has been subjected to human exploitation and degradation for 1,000s of
   years. Recently, several initiatives have tried to identify priority
   areas for conservation across the Mediterranean Sea. However, none of
   these efforts have led to large-scale actions yet. The aim of the
   workshop was to establish a network of scientists who are involved in
   large-scale conservation planning initiatives throughout the
   Mediterranean basin to promote collaboration and reduce redundancy in
   conservation initiatives. The three focus groups of the workshop build
   on existing efforts and intend to deliver: (1) a roadmap for setting
   conservation priorities, (2) a methodological framework for linking
   threats, actions and costs to improve the prioritization process, and
   (3) a systematic conservation planning process tailored to complex
   environments such as the Mediterranean Sea. Joining forces and involving
   more scientists (especially from the South-eastern part of the region)
   in following meetings, the participants endeavour to provide guidelines
   on how to bridge the science-policy gap and hence aid decision-makers to
   take efficient conservation actions.},

Title = {Global COVID-19 lockdown highlights humans as both threats and
   custodians of the environment},

Abstract = {The global lockdown to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic health risks has
   altered human interactions with nature. Here, we report immediate
   impacts of changes in human activities on wildlife and environmental
   threats during the early lockdown months of 2020, based on 877
   qualitative reports and 332 quantitative assessments from 89 different
   studies. Hundreds of reports of unusual species observations from around
   the world suggest that animals quickly responded to the reductions in
   human presence. However, negative effects of lockdown on conservation
   also emerged, as confinement resulted in some park officials being
   unable to perform conservation, restoration and enforcement tasks,
   resulting in local increases in illegal activities such as hunting.
   Overall, there is a complex mixture of positive and negative effects of
   the pandemic lockdown on nature, all of which have the potential to lead
   to cascading responses which in turn impact wildlife and nature
   conservation. While the net effect of the lockdown will need to be
   assessed over years as data becomes available and persistent effects
   emerge, immediate responses were detected across the world. Thus,
   initial qualitative and quantitative data arising from this
   serendipitous global quasi-experimental perturbation highlights the dual
   role that humans play in threatening and protecting species and
   ecosystems. Pathways to favorably tilt this delicate balance include
   reducing impacts and increasing conservation effectiveness.},
