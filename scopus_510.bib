	abstract = {Hydrogen is a viable clean energy source due to its high energy density and the fact that it burns without producing any carbon emissions. Nanostructured materials with tunable porosity have gathered significant attention for both hydrogen generation and hydrogen storage applications. This comprehensive review manuscript provides an in-depth overview of recent advancements in porosity tunability in nanostructures for hydrogen generation and hydrogen storage. With an emphasis on their porosity engineering tactics and their effects on hydrogen production efficiency and hydrogen storage capacity, it covers the synthesis procedures, characterization methodologies, and performance assessment of nanostructured materials. Sol-gel synthesis, hydrothermal synthesis, and chemical vapor deposition are the synthesis techniques covered in this paper. Through the careful control of nanostructured materials' size, shape, and composition, these techniques make it possible to precisely design porosity. These materials are characterized using methods like X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy to examine their crystal structure and shape. When evaluating the performance of nanostructured materials, methods like gas chromatography are used to estimate the efficiency of hydrogen generation, and gravimetric and volumetric measurements are used to determine the hydrogen storage capacity. Overall, understanding porosity engineering strategies and their impact on hydrogen generation and storage is crucial for the development of efficient and sustainable energy systems. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects in this field are discussed, aiming to guide future research and development efforts towards efficient and sustainable hydrogen production and storage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Multi-layer wound cylindrical shells are the preferred structures for storage vessels working in high pressure and hydrogen atmosphere. However, they are susceptible to external blast loads from accidental hydrogen explosions. In order to study the response of such structures under external blast loading, a numerical model was developed, which combined a thermo-viscoplastic constitutive model and a fluid-structure coupling approach, and was subjected to external blast loads of different TNT equivalency weights. The strain responses and initial velocity fields of the structure were analyzed. A rigid-plastic theoretical model was also developed to calculate the maximum displacement of the inner shell and was compared with the simulation results. Moreover, the axial velocity vibration histories and dominant frequencies at different locations of the steel belts were numerically obtained. In addition, four vibration modes of the steel belts were presented in this paper. Furthermore, strain growth was observed in the high-frequency vibration area, and the possible reasons for the strain growth were analyzed and discussed in detail. The results will be useful for predicting the deformation modes of such multi-layer wound cylindrical shell structures under the risk of external hydrogen explosions. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Salt caverns are extensively utilized for storing various substances such as fossil energy, hydrogen, compressed air, nuclear waste, and industrial solid waste. In China, when the salt cavern is leached through single-well water solution mining with oil as a cushion, engineering challenges arise with the leaching tubing, leading to issues like damage and instability. These problems significantly hinder the progress of cavern construction and the control of cavern shape. The primary cause of this is the flow-induced vibration instability of leaching tubing within a confined space, which results in severe bending or damage to the tubing. This study presents a model experimental investigation on the dynamic characteristics of leaching tubing using a self-developed liquid-solid coupling physical model experiment apparatus. The experiment utilizes a silicone-rubber pipe (SRP) and a polycarbonate pipe (PCP) to examine the effects of various factors on the dynamic stability of cantilevered pipes conveying fluid. These factors include external space constraint, flexural rigidity, medium outside the pipe, overhanging length, and end conditions. The experiments reveal four dynamic response phenomena: water hammer, static buckling, chaotic motion, and flutter instability. The study further demonstrates that the length of the external space constraint has a direct impact on the flutter critical flow velocity of the cantilevered pipe conveying fluid. Additionally, the flutter critical flow velocity is influenced by the end conditions and different external media. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Fire and explosion accidents frequently occur during hydrogen production, transportation, storage, and utilization processes, leading to significant casualties and economic losses. In this work, the characteristics of confined hydrogen explosions, hydrogen cloud explosions, and hydrogen blending explosions are summarized. Moreover, strategies for mitigating hydrogen deflagration, including explosion inhibition, explosion venting, and flame quenching, are analyzed. The results show that the deflagration behaviors of hydrogen under extreme initial conditions, such as low temperature and high pressure, are not yet well-understood. Research studies have demonstrate the marked effects of mitigating hydrogen deflagration, but this process has certain disadvantages. Porous materials and alkyl halides show dual promotion and inhibition effects. The suppression efficiency of inert gas and water mist must be improved.

	abstract = {Efficient storage solutions that decouple energy use and production are pivotal for the green energy transition, due to the non-controllable operation of solar and wind power. In this scenario, hydrogen, and in particular metal hydride storage, has shown excellent potential. In this paper we develop a mathematical model to characterize the operation of several cylindrical Metal Hydride-Phase Change Material tank layouts and to determine the improved configuration in terms of charge/discharge time and power. We use non-dimensional parameters to guide the design of a hybrid metal hydride-phase change material hydrogen storage system. We introduce a critical value for the state of charge of the storage system, equal to ϕc∗=0.15, above which heat exchange dominates the process efficiency. Results show that, when varying the canister main aspect ratio between 5 and 100, the equivalent inlet/outlet power increases by a factor ≈10. The ratio of the thermal conductivities is found to have a significant impact in the desorption phase, where the equivalent power increases by a factor ≈4 when raising the ratio from 0.1 to 0.8. Finally, we evaluate three case studies by introducing three different improved configurations and comparing them with the baseline design. A LaNi5/LiNO3−3H2O system for the storage of 1kWh of H2 exhibits 5.65kW and 0.83kW of average power in absorption and desorption, respectively. Such an improved configuration is 93% faster in charge/discharge process with respect to the baseline design. A coupled Mg2NiH4 - NaNO3 exhibits 2.93 kW and 0.30 kW of average power in absorption and desorption, respectively. This configuration is 81% faster than the baseline design. A coupled Mg2NiH4 - KNO3 exhibits 1.66 kW and 0.56 kW of average power in absorption and desorption, while the cycle time is reduced from 1220 min to 147 min (−88%). © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In this study, under the conformity of engineering reality, considering the influence of slip coefficient on the variation range of winding angle, 15 composite lay-up schemes of hydrogen storage vessels were designed using grid theory, and the hydrogen storage vessels's structural strength was analyzed. The distribution of non-geodesic fiber windings on the outer surface of the inner layer was solved using differential theory and the winding principle, and ABAQUS established the finite element model. The maximum stress value and stress distribution of the composite layer of the hydrogen storage vessel along the fiber direction were studied, the damage of the composite layer was analyzed, and the pressure and mode of the bursting were predicted. Results show that the structural strength of the hydrogen storage vessel designed by this method can be effectively guaranteed. The hoop winding layer bears the majority of the stress on the hydrogen storage vessel, while the helical winding layer's fiber strength is not entirely utilized. The hydrogen storage vessel gains greater structural strength when the circumferential winding layer is concentrated and situated at the outermost portion of the composite layer. The layup scheme has an impact of approximately 17.21% on burst pressure. Highlights: Effect of slip coefficient on the change of winding angle.

To accurately predict the hazard distance of hydrogen flare, it is necessary to develop a new flare radiation model. Also, the numerical simulations of hydrogen flame are carried out to assess the radiation hazard area of the flares. The results show that the hazard distances predicted by the numerical method and the new model agree well with the HSL data fitted by exponential regression, and the errors are less than ±5%. Furthermore, the new model and simulations were used to analyze the distribution of thermal radiation for hydrogen flare under various release conditions. Increasing the release rates will drive the hazard boundary of flare system to expand. Additionally, as flare height increases, the radiation damage from the flare flame on ground is reduced due to buoyancy of combustion products. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Global energy consumption is expected to reach 911 BTU by the end of 2050 as a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization. Hydrogen is increasingly recognized as a clean and reliable energy vector for decarbonization and defossilization across various sectors. Projections indicate a significant rise in global demand for hydrogen, underscoring the need for sustainable production, efficient storage, and utilization. In this state-of-the-art review, we explore hydrogen production methods, compare their environmental impacts through life cycle analysis, delve into geological storage options, and discuss hydrogen’s potential as a future transportation fuel. Combining electrolysis to make hydrogen and storing it in porous underground materials like salt caverns and geological reservoirs looks like a good way to balance out the variable supply of renewable energy and meet the demand at peak times. Hydrogen is a key component of our sustainable economy, and this article gives a broad overview of the process from production to consumption, touching on technical, economic, and environmental concerns along the way. We have made an attempt in this paper to compile different methods for the production of hydrogen and its storage, the challenges faced by current methods in the manufacturing of hydrogen gas, and the role of hydrogen in the future.

	abstract = {Steel ribbon wound vessel is a preferred type for stationary storage of high-pressure hydrogen in refueling stations. However, it is under the threat of fragment impact and blast loads caused by accidental explosions of hydrogen or other vessels. For the first time, the fragment-simulating projectile (FSP) impact tests with impact kinetic energy range from 1.8 × 103 J–4.9 × 103 J and external blast loading tests with TNT equivalent range from 157 g–4 kg of industrial-grade 50 MPa steel ribbon wound vessel were carried out. The damage of vessel under FSP impact loading was studied. The effect of concentrated and distributed blast loads on the deformation and damage of gas-filled vessel was analyzed, and the explosion resistance of vessel under near-field blast loading was explored. It is revealed that: 1) the steel ribbon wound vessels generally have good resistances to external blast and impact loads, 2) the primary damage characteristics of vessel under contact/near-field blast loading was localized depression deformation, accompanied by steel ribbons warping as the shock wave impulse increases, 3) the saddle fails earlier than the vessel under the near-field blast loading. Further, the failure modes of vessel under extreme blast loads were revealed. Results can provide reference for the safe design and validation of dynamic damage/failure analysis models of steel ribbon wound vessels. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), comprising: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain, is home to an abundant number of resources, including natural gas and solar and wind energy (renewables). Because of this, the region is favourably positioned to become a significant player in both blue and green hydrogen production and their export. Current dependence on fossil fuels and ambitious national targets for decarbonisation have led the region and world to research the feasibility of switching to a hydrogen economy. This literature review critically examines the current advantages and strategies adopted by the GCC to expedite the implementation of hydrogen supply chains, as well as investigation into the methodologies employed in current research for the modelling and optimisation of hydrogen supply chains. Insight into these endeavours is critical for stakeholders to assess the inherent challenges and opportunities in establishing a sustainable hydrogen economy. Despite a substantial global effort, establishing a solid hydrogen supply chain presently faces various obstacles, including the costs of clean hydrogen production. Scaling-up storage and transport methods is an issue that affects all types of hydrogen, including carbon-intensive (grey) hydrogen. However, the current costs of green hydrogen production, mostly via the process of electrolysis, is a major obstacle hindering the widescale deployment of clean hydrogen. Research in this literature review found that compressed gas and cryogenic liquid options have the highest storage capacities for hydrogen of 39.2 and 70.9 kg/m3, respectively. Meanwhile, for hydrogen transportation, pipelines and cryogenic tankers are the most conventional and efficient options, with an efficiency of over 99 %. Cryogenic ships to carry liquid hydrogen also show potential due to their large storage capacities of 10,000 tonnes per shipment, However, costs per vessel are currently still very expensive, ranging between $ 465 and $620 million. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Solid-state storage is a promising way to store hydrogen due to its high energy density. However, the development of a solid-state storage system is a complex problem due to various parameters affecting the systems. Several numerical models were developed in the past to analyse the behaviour of these systems but solving these numerical models required a lot of time and expertise. In this study, various machine learning models were developed by considering the most sensitive parameters obtained by a detailed literature review which affect the performance of metal hydride systems using LaNi5 as the storage material. The data required for training of these models were obtained by using a validated mathematical model solved using COMSOL software. The performance of all the developed machine learning models was compared and the most accurate model i.e., an artificial neural network was selected for further study. The development of this machine learning model helps designers and experts to evaluate the reaction fraction and bed temperature directly and quickly without undergoing detailed mathematical modelling which saves a lot of time and resources. Further, a new method was described in which the genetic algorithm was utilized to optimize the developed ANN model based on the application. The applicability of the developed method was then shown by optimizing various parameters at different time instances for the development of metal hydride hydrogen storage for vehicular applications. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is an emerging technology changing the context of heating with cleaner combustion than traditional fossil fuels. Studies indicate the potential to repurpose the existing natural gas infrastructure, offering consumers a sustainable, economically viable option in the future. The integration of hydrogen in combined heat and power systems could provide residential energy demand and reduce environmental emissions. However, the widespread adoption of hydrogen will face several challenges, such as carbon dioxide emissions from the current production methods and the need for infrastructure modification for transport and safety. Researchers indicated the viability of hydrogen in decarbonizing heat, while some studies also challenged its long-term role in the future of heating. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review is carried out by identifying the following key aspects, which could impact the conclusion on the overall role of hydrogen in heat decarbonization: (i) a holistic view of the energy system, considering factors such as renewable integration and system balancing; (ii) consumer-oriented approaches often overlook the broader benefits of hydrogen in emission reduction and grid stability; (iii) carbon capture and storage scalability is a key factor for large-scale production of low-emission blue hydrogen; (iv) technological improvements could increase the cost-effectiveness of hydrogen; (v) the role of hydrogen in enhancing resilience, especially during extreme weather conditions, raises the potential of hydrogen as a flexible asset in the energy infrastructure for future energy supply; and finally, when considering the UK as a basis case, (vi) incorporating factors such as the extensive gas network and unique climate conditions, necessitates specific strategies. © 2024 by the authors.},

Employing user-defined functions in the commercial software Ansys Fluent 15, a 2D numerical model was developed to assess thermal characteristics (temperature, heat flux, etc.) and kinetics of MH-hydrogenation, with a focus on the cooling fluid type. The reactor experiences diverse pressures (5–15 bar), an initial temperature of 298 K, and a coolant speed of 1 m/s. Validation of numerical results was performed against experimental data. The study delves into absorption properties of the storage reactor, examining crucial parameters such as hydrogen concentration, heat transfer coefficient of forced convection, and average temperature within the reactor. The findings reveal that coupling internal fins with water or oil as a coolant yields optimal performance, especially on an industrial scale. Nitrogen, on the other hand, exhibited the least favorable thermal performance, while the addition of fins significantly improved the cooling performance of the storage unit.

	abstract = {Geological hydrogen storage in depleted hydrocarbon fields is an emerging technology aimed at mitigating climate change. This review paper delves into the geological storage of hydrogen in depleted gas and oil reservoirs, focusing on using geopolymer cement as a pioneering solution to ensure the integrity and safety of wellbores during hydrogen storage within the oil and gas industry. Geopolymer cement, an innovative alternative to traditional Portland cement, exhibits remarkable mechanical strength and durability, making it capable of withstanding extreme loading conditions and chemical degradation. Its lower permeability further ensures secure hydrogen containment within the reservoir, minimizing leaks and environmental risks. Numerous studies have investigated the suitability of geopolymers for wellbore applications, highlighting their long-term durability, CO2 permeability control, mechanical robustness, self-healing properties, and chemical stability. The paper underscores the significance of these attributes in safeguarding wellbore structures under challenging downhole conditions, such as corrosive environments and high temperatures and pressures. While emphasizing the advantages of geopolymers, it acknowledges the need for further research and optimization in areas like mix compositions, scalability, and environmental impact. The future of geopolymers in wellbores for hydrogen storage holds great promise. Collaboration among stakeholders and regulatory bodies will be pivotal in realizing the potential of geopolymers and advancing clean energy technologies for a sustainable energy future. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS), especially in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is becoming increasingly attractive as a solution to H2 large-scale seasonal storage but there are several concerns regarding the repurposing of existing structures due to hydrogen detrimental effects on materials. This article aims to provide insight into the wellbore integrity challenges associated with UHS in depleted reservoirs. It briefly discusses past and current experiences of UHS. To identify knowledge gaps and technical barriers, an overview of wellbore integrity issues that could be encountered during UHS projects in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is presented. Since wellbore integrity issues lead to fluid migration, published work on leakage rate estimation and risk evaluation in storage projects are also discussed. Field wellbore integrity evaluation methods and analytical models are discussed as well as current potential site criteria for the UHS selection site. Based on the review, leakage through the injection and legacy wells are primary concerns on UHS projects. Wellbore integrity can be affected by hydrogen damage, microbial-induced corrosion and corrosion processes on metallic materials, cement degradation due to hydrogen and corrosive agents exposure, and the severe conditions to which the materials are exposed through the wellbore life. In addition, the existence of legacy wells in poor conditions represents a risk to the safety of UHS projects. Future works were recommended to better comprehend hydrogen damage processes, hydrogen interaction with casing, cement, and subsurface microbiological processes, and to establish multi-criteria selection methods for potential sites. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Temporal and spatial gaps exist between hydrogen production and utilization, necessitating infrastructure like storage and transportation for bridging. The challenge in optimizing hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) for transportation path planning lies in efficiently solving the complex network topology. This work presents a mathematical model of two-layer optimization based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and graph theory. Transportation route planning and wind farm selection are integrated to meet the hydrogen demand of hydrogen fuel vehicles (HFVs) over a period of time. The model enables the extraction of geographic information data and visualization of the optimal layout using ArcGIS software. Vehicle transportation and pipeline route hybrid transportation system based on Minimum Euclidean Steiner Tree (MEST) are obtained. The goal is to obtain the minimum total annual cost (TAC).

	abstract = {This article explores the main mechanisms that can generate damage in polymers and polymer-based materials used for hydrogen storage and distribution infrastructures. All of these mechanisms are driven by the permeability process that is enhanced by the operating temperature and pressure conditions. Hydrogen storage and delivery systems typically work under high pressure and a relatively wide range of temperatures, especially during the filling and emptying processes. Therefore, it is of great interest to better understand how this phenomenon can influence the integrity of polymer-based hydrogen infrastructures in order to avoid catastrophic events and to better design/investigate new optimized solutions. The first part of this paper discusses the main storage and delivery solutions for gas and liquid hydrogen. Then, the physics of the permeability is investigated with a focus on the effect of pressure and temperature on the integrity of polymers working in a hydrogen environment. Finally, the main mechanisms that mostly induce damage in polymers operating in a hydrogen environment and that influence their mechanical properties are explored and discussed. Particular focus was placed on the rapid gas decompression and aging phenomena.

	abstract = {Thermochemical energy storage (TES) systems using coupled metal hydrides (MHs) have long been recognized as an option for sustainable energy systems such as solar power plants. The MHs-TES system consists of two linked MH beds (energy storage bed and hydrogen storage bed) that exchange hydrogen during the heat storage/release cycles. The heat reaction of the hydrogen storage bed is stored in a PCM as latent heat, which is recovered during the heat release step. One of the main issues of the MHs-TES system is selecting the best-suited combination of MHs and compatible PCM to satisfy application requirements. Herein, an approach is proposed for screening the right pairs of hydrides and the suitable PCM. To assess this procedure's effectiveness, a 2D-mathematical model is developed, and a computer code is established. In addition, using this code, the dynamic behavior of the MHs-TES system and the effect of the hydrogen storage bed temperature on the system's performance are examined. The Mg2Fe alloy as HTMH bed, and two LTMH beds as LTMH (LaNi4.25Al0.75 at medium temperature and LaNi5 at low temperature) are used. With an efficiency of 86.5%, the results show that Mg2Fe/LaNi5 is a viable MHs combination for a thermal storage system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

In this view, Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) are a class of molecules that allow for easier long term energy storage compared to conventional H2 technologies. CFD simulations were used to showcase the hydrodynamics of the dehydrogenation of a LOHC in a new reactor unit, via a cold flow mock-up study. This reactor was designed to allow for a swirling motion of the liquid carrier material, favouring the removal of H2 gas from the flow and forcing the equilibrium of the reaction towards dehydrogenation, as well as to keep the catalyst particles in motion. The CFD simulations were validated qualitatively with experimental operation of the reactor, in a system with identical dimensionless numbers (Reynolds and Stokes), in order to use less costly products during the prototyping phase. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The formation of magnesium hydrides through the chemical reaction between magnesium and hydrogen gas is considered one of the most effective hydrogen storage methods. During this reaction process, thermal management is crucial to maintain the reaction active because of the large amount of heat generated, but has been challenging due to the poor heat transfer in the powder bed. In this study, a novel reactor of tooth-shaped configuration is designed for Mg-based hydrogen gas storage, where the hydrogen is not only the stored gas but also serves as the cooling medium in direct contact with the Mg powders. The hydrogen gas in the reactor can flow uniformly through the interior of the Mg plate of compacted powders at a relatively high rate. The proposed direct contact cooling reactor with tooth-shaped configuration is studied numerically in comparison with another direct contact cooling reactor with parallel sheet configuration as well as the traditional reactor with a second cooling medium. The required reaction time for storage for the tooth-shaped configuration is 40% and 78% lower compared with that of the parallel sheet configuration and the traditional reactor, respectively. The reaction rate increases with higher flow rate of hydrogen gas, although at the cost of higher pumping power. When the hydrogen storage rate and the storage density of the total system are the main considerations, the tooth-shaped configuration with flow-through hydrogen demonstrates clear advantages over the other two reactors. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Ultrafine-grained and heterostructured materials are currently of high interest due to their superior mechanical and functional properties. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) is one of the most effective methods to produce such materials with unique microstructure-property relationships. In this review paper, after summarizing the recent progress in developing various SPD methods for processing bulk, surface and powder of materials, the main structural and microstructural features of SPD-processed materials are explained including lattice defects, grain boundaries and phase transformations. The properties and potential applications of SPD-processed materials are then reviewed in detail including tensile properties, creep, superplasticity, hydrogen embrittlement resistance, electrical conductivity, magnetic properties, optical properties, solar energy harvesting, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, hydrolysis, hydrogen storage, hydrogen production, CO2 conversion, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. It is shown that achieving such properties is not limited to pure metals and conventional metallic alloys, and a wide range of materials are currently processed by SPD, including high-entropy alloys, glasses, semiconductors, ceramics and polymers. It is particularly emphasized that SPD has moved from a simple metal processing tool to a powerful means for the discovery and synthesis of new superfunctional metallic and nonmetallic materials. The article ends by declaring that the borders of SPD have been extended from materials science and it has become an interdisciplinary tool to address scientific questions such as the mechanisms of geological and astronomical phenomena and the origin of life. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {As global energy consumption is rapidly climbing to maximum, fossil fuel resources face depletion on a global scale. The rapid depletion and higher energy demand consequences an escalation of energy prices originating from conventional sources as well as the release of greenhouse gases into the environment. Hydrogen as an alternative energy source merged as an ideal candidate, distinguished by its remarkable attributes and manifold advantages. It has an exceptional energy density of 120 MJ/kg and encompasses non-toxicity, sustainability, and a favorable environmental profile. Renewable and non-renewable sources can produce hydrogen and have versatile applications in transportation, power generation via fuel cells, and other industrial processes. Beyond having these advantages hydrogen has the benefits of energy security and can be produced locally. Nevertheless, commercial hydrogen has exceptionally low volumetric density under standard conditions which is the major obstacle in the way of its development. To cater this issue and to enhance its economic feasibility, two well-established methodologies are used by alterations in temperature and/or pressure conditions which facilitate the storage of hydrogen either in a pressurized gas or a cryogenic liquid. However, both methods incur energy consumption and pose safety concerns and complexity in the system, which raises the question of having other storage solutions. An emerging technology based on Solid-state hydrogen storage systems has recently gained substantial attention because of its high storage capacity and relatively mild temperature and pressure requirements. However, this technology is not yet mature enough because it doesn't fulfil the requirements to be implemented for industrial applications. But, intensive research in this field is underway to develop novel materials with enhanced performance at both the material and the system level. The current review report is focused on a comprehensive and in-depth comparative analysis of various hydrogen storage methods, with a major focus on the enhancement of the performance of the material which is suitable for solid-state hydrogen storage applications. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In this work, we concentrate on a comprehensive experimental and numerical investigation of metal hydride beds with rare earth-based (RE-Ca)(Ni-Co)5 optimized alloy to explore faster reaction rates. Two different cylindrical tanks were manufactured to reflect de-/hydrogenation characteristics. A study on the temperature evolution in the loose powder bed was performed first, followed by five other different bed configurations: alternated powder layers with Al fiber layers, powder mixed with Al fibers, compacted discs (mixture of powder, resin and graphite), alternated compacts with Al fins and alternated Al foil-wrapped compacts with Al fins. Among them, the compacts provide good heat transfer capacity, with additional Al foils and fins for optimum thermal diffusion, reducing the reaction time by almost 50 %. Stress concentrations caused by powder accumulation can also be avoided thanks to the stable structure. Finally, the numerical model was adapted to simulate the de-/hydrogenation processes of the optimized bed and the experimental data matched well with the computational results, confirming the reliability of the model. It lays the foundation for the design and operation optimization of high-density hydrogen storage in the future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Specifically, the central cylinder in the skid exhibits a temperature 9% higher than the corners. Controlling the valve opening ratio effectively regulates temperature and pressure in the nine cylinders. Reducing the valve opening ratio to 75% from 100% decreases the temperature by 13 °C and the pressure by 10 MPa.

	abstract = {Some metals and metal alloys can store gaseous hydrogen, making the storage of hydrogen in metal hydrides (MHs) possible. For the MH reactor to store hydrogen at a higher rate, improved heat transfer is required. The 2-D material graphene oxide (GO) attracted researchers’ attention due to its excellent thermal properties. The present work aims to improve heat transfer and hydrogen storage rate of the LaNi5 MH reactor. A 2-D axis-symmetric numerical model of the reactor is formed and simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6 software. Water and its based nanofluids (NFs), namely, GO, GO-SiO2 (50:50), GO-TiO2 (50:50), and Al2O3 are employed as heat transfer fluids (HTFs). The effect of inlet temperature and flow velocity of the HTF; and hydrogen supply pressure on the reactor performance is examined. The findings demonstrate that the storage rate is greatly improved by lowering the HTF inlet temperature; and increasing its inlet velocity and hydrogen supply pressure. In comparison to water and all other NFs, the GO NF with 1 vol% demonstrated comparatively better heat transfer. It reduces the duration by 61.7% of that of water to attain 90% hydrogen storage capacity at similar conditions. The data acquired in the numerical investigations were used to build a prediction metamodel using the evolutionary machine learning (ML) technique of gene expression programming (GEP). © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Electrostatic safety is a critical and significant issue in the transportation and storage of liquid hydrogen. The generation and accumulation of excess electrical charges in the transmission pipeline and storage tank can lead to the formation of an internal static electric field, potentially resulting in hazardous situations. To ensure the safety of liquid hydrogen systems, it is essential to analyze the electrostatic characteristics within the tank and conduct risk assessments based on safety boundaries. This study establishes a theoretical model to describe the distribution of electrical potential and the dynamic development of charge density, considering the effects of relaxation and dissipation. Through an extensive series of simulations, several critical conclusions have been drawn. Regarding static electrostatic characteristics, it is observed that the electrical potential within the storage tank exhibits a non-isotropic distribution. Increasing the charge density, scale factor, and diameter-height ratio intensifies the electrical potential and enhances the electrostatic risk. However, there exists an optimal filling fraction that yields the highest surface electrical potential. In terms of transient characteristics during the filling process, a peak electrical potential is observed when charged liquid hydrogen is injected into the tank. Elevating the charge density and filling flux significantly increases the electrical potential and escalates the electrostatic risk. Conversely, increasing the initial filling fraction beyond 30 % slightly reduces the risk. Taking a reference critical potential of 30 kV, a charge density of 1 × 10−5 C/m3 is identified as the critical value for static conditions within the tank. For dynamic filling processes, a charge density of 0.019 C/m3 in the transmission pipeline serves as another critical value, acting as the safety boundary. In conclusion, this work provides a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the electrostatic characteristics of liquid hydrogen storage tanks. Furthermore, it conducts well-founded risk assessments for liquid hydrogen systems, thereby significantly contributing to the safety of transportation and storage practices involving liquid hydrogen. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

It is expected that the near future will cover CO2-capturing technologies integrated with solar-based H2 production at a commercially viable level, and over 5 billion tons of CO2 are expected to be utilized potentially for clean fuel production worldwide in 2050 to achieve carbon-neutral levels. The H2 production out of hydrocarbon-based processes using fossil fuels emits greenhouse gas emissions of 17-38 kg CO2/kg H2. On the other hand,. renewable energy based green hydrogen production emits less than 2 kg CO2/kg H2 which makes it really clean and appealing for implementation. In addition, capturing CO2 and using for synthesizing alternative fuels with green hydrogen will help generate clean fuels for smart cities. In this regard, the most sustainable and promising CO2 capturing method is post-combustion with an adsorption-separation-desorption processes using monoethanolamine adsorbent with high CO2 removal efficiencies from flue gases.

	abstract = {Hydrogen, as a clean and efficient energy source, is important in achieving zero-CO2 targets. This paper explores the potential of hydrogen geologic storage (HGS) in China for large-scale energy storage, crucial for stabilizing intermittent renewable energy sources and managing peak demand. Despite its promise, HGS faces challenges due to hydrogen's low density and viscosity, and its complex interactions with geological formations and microorganisms. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the current research status for HGS, with a particular focus on highlighting the main challenges confronting China. These difficulties and challenges primarily arise from complex geological conditions and the absence of fundamental parameters within potential reservoirs, including depleted oil/gas fields, salt caverns, and brine aquifers. Additionally, we have synthesized the current applications of machine learning (ML)as a potential solution. Key challenges are examined, such as the effects of operational parameters (e.g., cyclical injection-production and injection rates) on HGS efficiency, which can influence phenomena such as hydrogen fingering and caprock integrity. This review also looks into the insufficiently understood hydrogen-water-rock geochemical reactions under diverse temperatures and pressures, a gap that hampers the development of predictive numerical simulations and raises concerns about hydrogen leakage due to changes in porosity and permeability. Additionally, the paper addresses the limited knowledge about the metabolic mechanisms of subsurface microorganisms under extreme conditions, highlighting potential risks of hydrogen leakage and groundwater contamination. These microorganisms can metabolize hydrogen, producing gases such as CH4 and H2S, which may cause steel corrosion. Furthermore, the study assesses the distribution and prospects of three primary methods for pure hydrogen storage in China, considering the current state of hydrogen development and relevant government policies. The role of ML in advancing HGS is also discussed, offering insights into future research directions. This review not only scrutinizes the scientific challenges of HGS but also underscores its potential, guiding future simulation and practical engineering applications in this field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Lined rock caverns (LRC) to store high-pressure hydrogen is a creative way to increase the utilization of renewable energy to satisfy enormous energy demands for society. The stability and permeability of LRC will determine the success or failure of hydrogen storage. Therefore, numerical simulations can be used to evaluate the damage to supporting structures and the stability of surrounding rock mass. However, the birth of new materials and new structures has changed the previous structural form of LRC for underground energy storage. This paper provided reinforced ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) as a supporting structure in LRC. Considering the first hydrogen storage LRC project in China, the mechanical behavior of UHPC is introduced in detail, and a quasi-three-dimensional finite element model is given. The numerical results of this model were evaluated considering the corresponding specifications for underground engineering, and the allowable upper limit pressure of LRC was suggested. To construct shallow-buried hydrogen storage LRC, reinforced UHPC could be a reliable support method and will be constructed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy, characterized by its high calorific value and sustainability, represents a secondary clean energy source. It is predominantly stored, transported, and utilized through pipeline networks. However, a comprehensive optimization approach for the design for the ground pipeline network of hydrogen storage is currently lacking. This paper embarks on a systematic exploration of the layout, station type and parameter design for the ground pipeline network of hydrogen storage. Addressing various application perspectives, the study constructs two distinct pipeline network structures: the Star-Star Global Optimization Model (SSGO-Model) and the Star-Tree Global Optimization Model (STGO-Model). Three cases are discussed under six different constraint scenarios. These scenarios focus on layout optimization, variable capacity layout optimization, and the overall optimization of layout and parameters. An overall optimization strategy is proposed to solve the models. A detailed analysis of the iteration process, layout schemes, station and pipeline constraints, investment, and flow parameters of the pipeline network in the optimization results is presented. Through systematic analysis, the correctness and effectiveness of the model are verified, demonstrating the variability of optimization results under different topological structures and constraint conditions. Moreover, when conducting integrated optimization, the total investment is minimized, proving its superiority. The findings demonstrate the applicability of these models in guiding the construction for the ground pipeline network of hydrogen storage, thereby fostering the advancement of hydrogen storage technology. Concurrently, this research contributes significantly to the development of hydrogen energy, offering strategic insights and practical solutions for its efficient deployment. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

To extend the duration of space exploration missions, or even to enable them, the storage and refueling from a cryogenic on-orbit depot is necessary. We review reference missions, architectures, and technology demonstrators and explain the main operations that are considered as enablers for cryogenic storage and transfer.

	abstract = {Compared to other types of air-independent propulsion (AIP) technologies, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are gaining increasing recognition for applications in enclosed environments without air, such as underwater and aerospace scenarios. This is attributed to their large power density and silent operation. Although PEMFCs have reached a level of maturity in terrestrial applications nowadays, transitioning them from air supply (H2-air) to pure oxygen supply (H2-O2) still presents numerous technical challenges, as indicated by our literature review and analysis. These challenges primarily involve redesigning key materials, water and thermal management techniques, and system configurations at various scales, ranging from micro to macro levels. First, the oxygen-rich environments and higher operational voltage of H2-O2 PEMFCs will inevitably accelerate the corrosion rate of all PEMFCs components. Secondly, the active water and thermal management techniques adopted in H2-air PEMFCs no longer meet the requirements of energy efficiency and compactness in enclosed environments. Finally, current hydrogen sources technologies limit mission durations due to their relatively low energy storage density, and air compressors commonly used in H2-air PEMFCs are not compatible with H2-O2 PEMFCs. The nature of enclosed environments also necessitates more rigorous approaches to safety in system integration. This review systematically summarizes comprehensive enhancement strategies aimed at addressing these challenges. Developing anti-corrosive catalysts and supports in the catalyst layer, membrane, gas diffusion layer (GDL), and bipolar plate (BPP) can mitigate their degradation to prolong the lifespan of H2-O2 PEMFCs. Passive water and thermal management techniques are also essential for making PEMFCs practical in enclosed environments. Furthermore, advanced hydrogen and oxygen sources technologies are crucial for increasing energy storage density, and safety design is paramount for the urgent advancement of H2-O2 PEMFCs technology. These strategies are believed to accelerate the application of H2-O2 PEMFCs in enclosed environments and have been proven to be effective. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

A direct-cooling type hydrogen liquefier was designed, fabricated, and tested using a commercially available cryo-coolers, heat pipe, ortho-para converter, LN2 shield, and LN2 pre-cooler. In order to effectively carry out the experimental investigations in the presence of two cryo-coolers and LN2 shield in addition to the small-scale liquefaction system, this study introduced the new experimental system based on the cryogenic techniques. The production of liquid hydrogen could be achieved just by controlling the temperature and pressure inside the storage vessel. The cooling time of the vessel was reduced by approximately 100 min using new experimental system. The total time required to produce the same amount of liquid hydrogen, around 20L, was reduced by approximately 200 min. The experiments successfully demonstrated the liquefaction of hydrogen gas in the vessel at a rate of approximately 3.5L/h, corresponding to a level meter reading of 14.5 cm (6.95 % of the vessel's height). Therefore, the cooling time of the vessel and the total time required for liquid hydrogen production were found to be significantly influenced by the gas used to cool the initial container and the presence of LN2 shield. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Metal hydride storage system (MHSS) has been widely used mostly because of its large storage capacity and high degree of safety. The improvement of the heat transfer performance is one of possible techniques to enhance the overall MHSS performance. The well arrangement of the heat exchanger structure from a semi-cylindrical coil heat exchanger with central return tube (SCHE-CR) significantly reduces the hydrogen absorption duration. However, the modelling of the thermal behaviour for the SCHE-CR during desorption process is missing in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to develop a model for both hydrogen absorption and desorption processes and analyse the thermal performance during the cycle. Phase change material (PCM) is incorporated with the heat exchanger for further improvement of the MHSS performance. The storage is designed under three different PCM configurations, including PCM jacket, pool bed, and capsule. The numerical results report that the duration of the absorption-desorption cycle is reduced by over 50% when using SCHE-CR instead of a helical coil. The PCM configurations, especially the PCM capsule, increase the MHSS performance, especially during the absorption. The duration of one cycle is decreased by at least 39% when combining the SCHE-CR with PCM. The HTF temperature significantly affects the MHSS performance, especially during the desorption. Reduction in HTF temperature reduces the absorption duration by at least 15%, while increasing the HTF temperature reduces the desorption duration by at least 25%. The new MHSS configuration would be beneficial to enhance the heat exchange during the absorption-desorption cycle of industrial MHSS applications. © 2024 The Authors},

It is of great significance to explore the dynamic responses and damage modes of hydrogen storage vessels under impact loads to promote the intrinsic safety development of hydrogen storage vessels. In this paper, a finite element analysis model is developed for simulating the dynamic responses of vessels under the impact of fragments. The influences of the number of winding layers, impact velocity, fragment mass, and fragment shape are investigated. The results show that fragment impact is a kind of local damage behavior with two typical stages of hitting and rebounding. The impact resistance of vessels increases with the number of winding layers. Impact velocity and fragment mass are positively related to deformation and damage.

	abstract = {The accurate prediction of behavior for insulations within thermal battery can be impeded due to the fact that the thermal properties of insulations have not been thoroughly characterized under the complex conditions in which they operate. In this study, an effective and extendible model is developed based on fractal theory and finite element method to predict the flow and thermal properties for fibrous insulations within thermal batteries. Two common fibrous insulations are tested and verified with this model under the operating gas atmosphere of thermal battery. It is found that the predictive permeability and effective thermal conductivity agree well with the existing experimental data. Verification under various gas atmosphere shows that present model can reduce the relative error of existing model by 5.21–17.2 %. The gas contributed thermal conductivity for insulations filled with high thermal conductivity gas is always significant. In addition, under the tested pressure gradients, the deviations of temperature are generally greater than 1.42 % for air, methane and carbon dioxide atmosphere, but less than 0.7 % for hydrogen atmosphere. The high porosity of material, the large or reverse pressure gradient may strongly promote the influence of the energy migration within insulations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This review is generally about some significant applications related to thermal management of hydrogen storage in metal hydrides. First, the importance of hydrogen energy is given. Second, an introductive piece of information about metal hydrides is given and the significance of metal hydride usage in hydrogen storage is discussed. In the next chapter, the concept of nanofluid usage in regard to thermal management of hydrogen storage in metal hydrides is given. Later, one of the thermal management techniques of hydrogen storage in metal hydrides, PCM (phase change material) usage, is discussed with studies related to the subjects in literature. Finally, different applications of machine learning in thermal management of hydrogen storage in metal hydrides are considered. It has been shown that thermal control for hydrogen storage in metal hydrides may be effectively achieved by employing nanofluids based on nanoparticles that have been carefully chosen for the system. Generally, Al2O3, CuO, MgO, Fe2O3, GO, GO-SiO2, and GO-TiO2 nanoparticles are used.in metal hydride storage thermal management system. The nanoparticle type and its loading amount are among the most important parameters that affect the improved performance of the hydrogen storage in metal hydrides. The quantity, melting temperature, thickness, thermal conductivity, depth of usage, and volume dispersion of PCMs are the fundamental parameters that are investigated in the studies for optimal values, taking into account additional parameters related to the metal hydride reactor systems, such as supply pressure, inlet velocity, temperature, etc. In order to get a faster response and a more compact hydrogen system, it is necessary to identify the ideal PCM thickness. Up to a certain degree, the hydrogen storage system benefits from PCM's higher thermal conductivity. The majority of machine learning research have been conducted to evaluate various characteristics and assess the potential of appropriate materials, metal hydrides, metals, material combinations, etc. for hydrogen storage. The findings of the studies under discussion have confirmed that machine learning is an effective, realistic means of predicting the parameters influencing hydrogen storage processes without sacrificing any of the drawbacks of experimental methods, such as high costs and lengthy search times. Future research should take into account more experimental investigations as well as a cost analysis of employing nanofluids and PCMs. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {One of the challenges associated with the use of hydrogen is its storage and transportation. Hydrogen pipelines are an essential infrastructure for transporting hydrogen from offshore production sites to onshore distribution centers. This paper presents an innovative analysis of the pressure drops, velocity profile, and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) in various hydrogen transportation scenarios, examining the influence of pipeline type (steel vs. composite), diameter, and outlet pressure. The role of the compressor and the pipeline, individually and together, was assessed for 1,000 and 100 tons of hydrogen. Notably, the LCOH was highly sensitive to these parameters, with the compressor contribution ranging between 21.52% and 85.11% and the pipeline's share varying from 14.89% to 78.48%. The outflow pressure and diameter of the pipeline have a significant impact on the performance: when 1,000 tons of hydrogen is transported, the internal pressure drop ranges from 2 to 30 bar and the flow velocity can vary between 2 and 25 m/s. For equivalent hydrogen quantities, the composite pipeline exhibits the same trends but with minor variations in the specific values. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The climate emergency has prompted rapid and intensive research into sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy alternatives. Offshore wind has developed and exceeded all expectations over the last 2 decades and is now a central pillar of the UK and other international strategies to decarbonise energy systems. As the dependence on variable renewable energy resources increases, so does the importance of the necessity to develop energy storage and nonelectric energy vectors to ensure a resilient whole-energy system, also enabling difficult-to-decarbonise applications, e.g. heavy industry, heat, and certain areas of transport. Offshore wind and marine renewables have enormous potential that can never be completely utilised by the electricity system, and so green hydrogen has become a topic of increasing interest. Although numerous offshore and marine technologies are possible, the most appropriate combinations of power generation, materials and supporting structures, electrolysers, and support infrastructure and equipment depend on a wide range of factors, including the potential to maximise the use of local resources. This paper presents a critical review of contemporary offshore engineering tools and methodologies developed over many years for upstream oil and gas (O&G), maritime, and more recently offshore wind and renewable energy applications and examines how these along with recent developments in modelling and digitalisation might provide a platform to optimise green hydrogen offshore infrastructure. The key drivers and characteristics of future offshore green hydrogen systems are considered, and a SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat) analysis is provided to aid the discussion of the challenges and opportunities for the offshore green hydrogen production sector.  © Copyright: },

	abstract = {Metal hydride hydrogen storage technology is considered a potential alternative energy and energy storage solution in promoting global economic decarbonization. However, the heat transfer coefficient between hydrogen storage materials and reactors is relatively low, which cannot meet the heat transfer and hydrogen storage requirements of the metal hydride tank. This study employs a triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) based hydrogen storage reactor and design of experiments (DOE) to reveal the relationship between various parameters and their characteristics. The multi-physics coupling of fluid flow, heat transfer, chemical reactions, and stress in a metal hydride hydrogen storage reactor is also combined to promote the synergistic improvement of heat transfer and hydrogen storage efficiency. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the hydrogen absorption volume fraction of tank equipped with TPMS is 0.926, which is significantly higher than that of conventional finned one. The absorption of hydrogen leads to volume expansion, resulting in a 30.61 % increase in expansion stress. Furthermore, the optimal hydrogen absorption volume fraction occurs at a temperature of 273.15 K, a pressure of 3.49 MPa, and a velocity of 5 m/s. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The self-pressurization process of cryogenic propellant storage under a normal gravity condition often involves turbulent mixing in the liquid region and complex flow fields in the vapor region caused by heat leak into a cryogenic tank. Over time, the cryogenic tank pressurizes due to a temperature increase in the vapor phase and the heat and mass transfer across the liquid–vapor interface. A nodal simulation approach was employed to study the long term transients of tank self-pressurization. In this paper, mechanistic models and correlations were implemented to simulate the self-pressurization of Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed experiments with a commercial nodal code, namely, Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer with Fluid Integrator (SINDA/FLUINT). A lump number sensitivity study on the prediction of tank pressure and temperature was performed to determine the number of lumps appropriate for a 50% initial liquid fill level. Uniform heat flux boundary conditions were implemented on both phases during the tank self-pressurization with an estimated heat leak provided by NASA. Numerical simulation showed that the predicted pressure profiles of the 50% and 90% fill level cases agreed well with experimental data. In the liquid region, temperatures were primarily uniform and close to saturation due to turbulent natural convection mixing. Findings showed the current model overestimated the temperature profiles in the vapor region when assuming heat conduction transfer. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

These caverns are utilized for storage and subsequent retrieval of hydrocarbons, hydrogen gas or compressed air in Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) plants. The retrieval operation involves pumping brine downwards through a long cantilevered pipe (“brine-string”) into the cavern, causing the lighter-than-brine gaseous or liquid “product” stored in the cavern to flow upwards and out of the cavern through a shorter annular passage formed by a concentric casing surrounding the upper portion of the pipe. The presence in the cavern of two different fluids with a variable interface level is taken into account. Employing a Newtonian derivation of the equation of motion solutions were obtained via the Galerkin modal decomposition technique, demonstrating that the brine-string may develop buckling or flutter at high-enough flow rates, depending on the system parameters. Extensive computations investigated the influence of system parameters on the dynamics. It is shown that simplifying the system by considering a single fluid in the cavern, and so for the flows within and around the brine-string, leads to unrealistically high critical flow velocity predictions. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, a knowledge gap exists concerning the site-specific performance and economic viability of utilizing underground gas storage (UGS) sites for hydrogen storage in Europe. We compile information on European UGS sites to assess potential hydrogen storage capacity and evaluate the associated current and future costs. The total hydrogen storage potential in Europe is 349 TWh of working gas energy (WGE), with site-specific capital costs ranging from $10 million to $1 billion. Porous media and salt caverns, boasting a minimum storage capacity of 0.5 TWh WGE, exhibit levelized costs of $1.5 and $0.8 per kilogram of hydrogen, respectively. It is estimated that future levelized costs associated with hydrogen storage can potentially decrease to as low as $0.4 per kilogram after three experience cycles.

	abstract = {The solid-state hydrogen storage in metal hydride (MH) is safer and energy efficient than the gaseous and liquid storage methods. The absorption of hydrogen in MH is highly exothermic. Hence, a good heat management system is required to increase the charging rate. The phase change material (PCM) can be integrated into the reactor to reuse the absorption heat for hydrogen desorption. The present numerical study models the concentric cylindrical reactor with magnesium (Mg) as MH surrounded by sodium nitrate (NaNO3) as PCM using COMSOL Multiphysics v6.1. The effect of buoyancy inside the PCM domain is investigated. An iterative approach is used to determine the required amount of PCM. Copper fins are added inside both MH and PCM. The effect of the number of fins, corresponding fin thickness and pitch on hydrogen absorption are determined to optimize the MH reactor. The outcomes reveal that the hydrogen absorption rate increases with fin numbers. The reactor with 10 and 30 fins takes 86.5 and 97.3 % less time than without fins for 90 % hydrogen absorption, respectively. The novel approach is proposed to estimate the fin efficiency (ηf) using temperature profiles of MH and fin during prevailing unsteady heat and mass transfer. The fin factor (Ff) is presented using the ηf and mass of MH. The performance evaluation criterion (PEC) is discussed based on hydrogen absorption relative to the system's weight. Further, the effect of operating parameters like hydrogen supply pressure and the initial temperature is studied on the reactor performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Renewable solar energy-powered multi-generation systems have become cutting-edge technology in the effort to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. This research introduces and evaluates a new multi-generation system that generates eco-friendly hydrogen, electricity, and thermal energy. The suggested system consists of a solar photovoltaic heat pipe (PVT) collector, stratified water storage, and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. Increasing the electrical power generated by solar PVT systems helps meet the electrolyzer's power needs, resulting in increased oxygen and hydrogen production. A thermal stratification tank combined with a solar PVT heat pipe collector result in higher thermal and electrical power output from the solar PVT heat pipe collector. For the first time, this work proposes a solar PVT heat pipe collector combined with stratification tank storage and a PEM electrolyzer. An engineering equation solver (EES) is utilized to analyze the thermodynamic fluctuations in temperature within the stratification tank storage and the PVT heat pipe collector. It also evaluates the electrical power generation and efficiency of the solar heat pipe PVT collector, as well as the production rates of hydrogen and oxygen and the efficiency of the electrolyser. This research aims to evaluate the efficiency of a novel configuration for generating green hydrogen and oxygen in warm oceanic areas, with a specific focus on Pau City, France. The findings reveal that increased solar radiation enhances the electrical output of the solar PVT heat pipe and the hydrogen and oxygen production rates of the electrolyser. Under Pau's climatic conditions for three summer days, the solar heat pipe PVT collector achieved an electrical power output of 92.63 W/m2, a hydrogen production rate of 1.154 g/min, and an oxygen production rate of 9.712 g/min. For the same period, the respective values were 73.12 W/m2, 0.9393 g/min, and 7.449 g/min. Additionally, the efficiency of the PVT collector varied, with a minimum efficiency of 0.1345 on sunny days and a higher minimum efficiency of 0.1432 on colder days. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

A 2D numerical model developed using ANSYS Fluent 14.0, sub-models for adsorption were incorporated, based on elements of Dubinin-Asatkhov (D-A) adsorption isotherms and kinetics, to analyze temperature variations, heat flux densities, and melting fractions during hydrogen adsorption and PCM melting. The significance of this work lies in examining the combined effects of different fin materials and reactor inclination angles (0°, 45°, 90°) on the cooling performance of the PCM paraffin RT22HC especially in large-scale system AC systems. The aim is to identify optimal design and operational parameters that enhance energy storage performance. Results highlight the significant impact of metal fins, particularly Copper fins, which exhibited the highest melting fraction of PCM and enhanced heat transfer performance. Copper fins led to a substantial increase in the melting fraction of PCM by approximately 30 % compared to AC reactor without fins leading to enhancement ratio of 71 %. The examination of tilting angle variations (0°, 45°, 90°) during hydrogen adsorption has a small effect on PCM fusion rates, with subtle effects observed in the distribution of gravitational forces and natural convection patterns within the system. The findings highlight the importance of material selection, design considerations, and operational scale in achieving optimal energy storage solutions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {To improve the recovery of waste heat and avoid the problem of abandoning wind and solar energy, a multi-energy complementary distributed energy system (MECDES) is proposed, integrating waste heat and surplus electricity for hydrogen storage. The system comprises a combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system with a gas engine (GE), solar and wind power generation, and miniaturized natural gas hydrogen production equipment (MNGHPE). In this novel system, the GE’s waste heat is recycled as water vapor for hydrogen production in the waste heat boiler, while surplus electricity from renewable sources powers the MNGHPE. A mathematical model was developed to simulate hydrogen production in three building types: offices, hotels, and hospitals. Simulation results demonstrate the system’s ability to store waste heat and surplus electricity as hydrogen, thereby providing economic benefit, energy savings, and carbon reduction. Compared with traditional energy supply methods, the integrated system achieves maximum energy savings and carbon emission reduction in office buildings, with an annual primary energy reduction rate of 49.42–85.10% and an annual carbon emission reduction rate of 34.88–47.00%. The hydrogen production’s profit rate is approximately 70%. If the produced hydrogen is supplied to building through a hydrogen fuel cell, the primary energy reduction rate is further decreased by 2.86–3.04%, and the carbon emission reduction rate is further decreased by 12.67–14.26%. This research solves the problem of waste heat and surplus energy in MECDESs by the method of hydrogen storage and system integration. The economic benefits, energy savings, and carbon reduction effects of different building types and different energy allocation scenarios were compared, as well as the profitability of hydrogen production and the factors affecting it. This has a positive technical guidance role for the practical application of MECDESs. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Solid-state hydrogen storage tanks are key equipment for fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen storage. However, the low heat transfer properties of hydrogen storage tanks result in the inability to meet the hydrogen supply requirements of fuel cells. In this study, different thermal management approaches were explored through the design of LaNi5-based solid-state hydrogen storage tanks. We experimentally studied the effects of different internal heat transfer methods, that is, expanded natural graphite (ENG), copper foam, and copper fins on the hydrogen absorption and desorption performance. We also studied the effects of external cooling methods with natural convection, air cooling, and water cooling, respectively. Under the same external cooling method of natural convection, a solid hydrogen storage tank filled with 5 wt.% ENG has similar performance to a tank filled with copper foam. Compared to natural convection, air and water cooling can significantly improve the heating performance of metal hydride (MH) beds by increasing the external heat transfer coefficient. The effect of water cooling is better than that of air cooling, and in these two enhanced performance conditions, the tank filled with copper foam performs better than with ENG. In the case of water cooling, by adding copper fins to a hydrogen storage tank filled with 5 wt.% ENG, the tank was saturated with hydrogen absorption in only 29.4 min, which is 55.6 % shorter than the hydrogen uptake time in a hydrogen storage reactor without copper fins. And its stable hydrogen desorption (1 NL/min) has reached 98.1 % of the total hydrogen released. The results show that the effective thermal conductivity and heat transfer area of metal hydride bed play key roles in improving heat transfer and reaction rate. In addition, heat transfer is more important than mass transfer to improve the performance of the hydrogen storage tank. © 2024},

	abstract = {With the shift in power generation methods from conventional to renewable, the need for energy storage has increased, and hydrogen as a carrier has great potential. The storage of hydrogen is one of the main obstacles to the effective deployment of the hydrogen economy. Since metal hydride offers a higher energy density than conventional methods, it can potentially be used to store and deliver hydrogen. Also, the metal hydride hydrogen storage system is the primary element of the energy storage system that connects hydrogen production and consumption. Therefore, the present study is focused on the development and testing of a metal hydride reactor. In the present experimental study, 9 kg of La0.7Ce0.1Ca0.3Ni5 is loaded in a single tube copper finned reactor attached to an external jacket, and the charging and discharging characteristics related to hydrogen storage are analysed along with variations in its thermal performance under various operating conditions. Also, the effect of HTF temperature on the hydrogen release performance of the copper finned reactor is studied under constant discharge pressure and constant discharge flow rate. Further, a comparison has been made between the copper and aluminium finned reactors. This fabricated copper finned reactor attained volumetric and gravimetric storage densities of 21.78 kg per m3 of H2 and 0.77%, respectively. The results indicated that La0.7Ce0.1Ca0.3Ni5 filled within the copper finned reactor stores 1.45 wt.% (130.7 g) of hydrogen in 680 s, corresponding to 25 bar feed gas pressure. At the HTF temperature of 60 °C, the copper-finned reactor discharged 1.42 wt.% (127.3 g) of hydrogen in 1450 s, showing the release of 98% of the stored mass of hydrogen. Further, the developed copper finned MH reactor could supply hydrogen at a constant rate of 13 lpm with a capability of 90% discharge even at a discharge temperature of 30 °C. Beside this, the comparative results showed that adding copper fins showed a considerable improvement over aluminium fins during discharging compared to the charging process. The copper-finned reactor consumed 20.9% and 23.6% less time to release 1 wt.% of hydrogen than the aluminium-finned reactor at discharge temperatures of 40 °C and 50 °C, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Bangladesh is a developing country heavily reliant on fossil fuels, which emits toxic gases during its combustion. In that scenario, hydrogen is an eco-friendly fuel source with a calorific value of 120 MJ/kg which is significantly higher than fossil fuels. With a density of 0.09 kg/m3 at 273 K, hydrogen is just 1/14th that of air. Considering the enriched agricultural resources of Bangladesh, biomass gasification emerges as the most advantageous method for hydrogen production. Compared to other methods like steam reforming and electrolysis, biomass gasification offers significant cost advantages. Furthermore, being an overpopulated country generates significant organic waste annually. The mismanagement of these wastes creates problematic situations for both lives and surroundings. This review approaches the way of waste management and hydrogen production and additionally discusses the current scenario, several hydrogen production pathways, utilization, and storage.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is considered a clean and efficient energy carrier crucial for shaping the net-zero future. Large-scale production, transportation, storage, and use of green hydrogen are expected to be undertaken in the coming decades. As the smallest element in the universe, however, hydrogen can adsorb on, diffuse into, and interact with many metallic materials, degrading their mechanical properties. This multifaceted phenomenon is generically categorized as hydrogen embrittlement (HE). HE is one of the most complex material problems that arises as an outcome of the intricate interplay across specific spatial and temporal scales between the mechanical driving force and the material resistance fingerprinted by the microstructures and subsequently weakened by the presence of hydrogen. Based on recent developments in the field as well as our collective understanding, this Review is devoted to treating HE as a whole and providing a constructive and systematic discussion on hydrogen entry, diffusion, trapping, hydrogen-microstructure interaction mechanisms, and consequences of HE in steels, nickel alloys, and aluminum alloys used for energy transport and storage. HE in emerging material systems, such as high entropy alloys and additively manufactured materials, is also discussed. Priority has been particularly given to these less understood aspects. Combining perspectives of materials chemistry, materials science, mechanics, and artificial intelligence, this Review aspires to present a comprehensive and impartial viewpoint on the existing knowledge and conclude with our forecasts of various paths forward meant to fuel the exploration of future research regarding hydrogen-induced material challenges. © 2024 The Authors.

The model not only focuses on optimizing network design parameters but also aims to minimize investment costs. To achieve this, the study proposes an innovative hybrid genetic algorithm that combines the Modified Feasible Directions Method (MFDM) and Genetic Algorithm Theory (GAT), specifically targeting the optimization of pipeline diameter's discrete distribution challenges. Comparative analyses with SUMT and GA algorithms demonstrate the superiority of the approach. In continuous space, the algorithm achieves a lower convergence cost of 232.4437 × 104 Yuan, while in discrete space, the cost further decreases to 212.1636 × 104 Yuan. Additionally, the study delves into the sensitivity of the HGA-MFDM algorithm to ambient temperature and wellhead temperature in hydrogen storage facilities. The analysis reveals that wellhead temperature has a more significant impact on pipeline network investment, whereas ambient temperature exhibits a more pronounced effect on iteration curves. The findings provide valuable insights for the precise adjustment and optimization of hydrogen storage pipeline networks in practical applications. © 2024},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is among the energy carriers, which are most often considered for bringing about a sustainable energy system. Yet, so far, hydrogen has not delivered as an energy carrier. The core objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art and the future prospects of green hydrogen in the European energy system from economic, energetic and CO2 emissions point-of-view. The analysis shows that there are some increasing opportunities for hydrogen use in industry and in the transport sector, when electrification is not possible or is too expensive, as well as a storage in the European electricity system. However, a hydrogen-based energy system will remain a vision at least over the next decades. The major reason for this is the unfavorable economics mostly due to high investment costs in the whole supply chain. In addition, the overall efficiencies in the hydrogen chains are moderate in general. The full environmental benignity of hydrogen as an energy carrier is only provided when renewable energy sources are used for hydrogen production. However, in Europe, the potentials for green hydrogen are very limited due to the insufficient expansion of renewable electricity generation. For this reason, many European countries are considering options for green hydrogen import. The future of hydrogen is highly dependent on the supporting policy framework. To reduce the risk in the investment in hydrogen infrastructure, as well as to justify the promotion of green hydrogen, it is very important that Europe works out a very clear and realistic long-term implementation strategy. © 2024 The Authors},

One of the most important areas of the energy transition is the development of hydrogen energy. This study aims to review and systematize the data available in the literature on the environmental and economic parameters of hydrogen storage and transportation technologies (both mature and at high technological readiness levels). The study concluded that salt caverns and pipeline transportation are the most promising methods of hydrogen storage and transportation today in terms of a combination of all parameters. These methods are the most competitive in terms of price, especially when transporting hydrogen over short distances. Thus, the average price of storage will be 0.35 USD/kg, and transportation at a distance of up to 100 km is 0.3 USD/kg. Hydrogen storage underground in a gaseous state and its transportation by pipelines have the least consequences for the environment: emissions and leaks are insignificant, and there is no environmental pollution. The study identifies these methods as particularly viable given their lower environmental impact and potential for seamless integration into existing energy systems, therefore supporting the transition to a more sustainable and circular economy. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The world is still largely dependent on oil and natural gas for its energy requirements which are harmful to the environment; therefore, it is high time that we look for alternative technologies for our growing energy needs. One such emerging area is fuel cell technology which produces clean energy in the form of electrical power. Integrating a Metal Hydride Hydrogen Storage (MHHS) system with a fuel cell can help increase energy efficiency. The heat dissipated during hydrogen absorption in MHHS can be used in other applications. In this paper, energy and exergy analysis of a fuel cell-based integrated system is performed. The system presents a Reversible Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell capable of working in dual modes, i.e., as an Electrolyser as well as a fuel cell. The MHHS and Vapour Absorption Refrigeration System (VARS) are coupled with a reversible fuel cell for hydrogen storage and cooling applications, respectively. While working in the fuel cell mode, maximum efficiency of 47.84% is evaluated at 80 °C. The system efficiency with and without the VARS system at 80 °C was 73.29% and 47.84%, respectively. On the contrary, in the electrolyzer mode, the maximum efficiency comes out to be 85.65%. The use of the MHHS system for hydrogen storage results in excess heat release, and as a result, the overall efficiency of the electrolyzer was increased to 94.05%. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the selected properties of HCNG fuel calculations and a literature review of the other fuels that allow the storage of ecologically produced hydrogen. Hydrogen has the most significant CO2 reduction potential of all known fuels. However, its transmission in pure form is still problematic, and its use as a component of fuels modified by it has now become an issue of interest for researchers. Many types of hydrogen-enriched fuels have been invented. However, this article will describe the reasons why HCNG may be the hydrogen-enriched fuel of the future and why internal combustion (IC) piston engines working on two types of fuel could be the future method of using it. CO2 emissions are currently a serious problem in protecting the Earth’s natural climate. However, secondarily, power grid stabilization with a large share of electricity production from renewable energy sources must be stabilized with very flexible sources—as flexible as multi-fuel IC engines. Their use is becoming an essential element of the electricity power systems of Western countries, and there is a chance to use fuels with zero or close to zero CO2 emissions, like e-fuels and HCNG. Dual-fuel engines have become an effective way of using these types of fuels efficiently; therefore, in this article, the parameters of hydrogen-enriched fuel selected in terms of relevance to the use of IC engines are considered. Inaccuracies found in the literature analysis are discussed, and the essential properties of HCNG and its advantages over other hydrogen-rich fuels are summarized in terms of its use in dual-fuel (DF) IC engines. © 2024 by the authors.},

Compared to dry conditions, significant more corrosion by presence of salt ions was detected. However, compared to X56, only for J55 an intensification of corrosion and cracking at the surface due to hydrogen atmosphere was revealed. Pronounced surface cracks were observed for J55 over the entire samples.

In this paper, for economically distributing hydrogen from the hydrogen plant to the terminal hydrogen refueling station, considering the daily hydrogen demand and transportation distance, firstly a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of the point-to-point hydrogen storage and transportation system based on compressed gas hydrogen (GH), liquid hydrogen (LH), pipeline hydrogen (PH), and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) is investigated, respectively. The optimal economical point-to-point energy storage and transportation modes under various transportation distance and daily hydrogen demand are obtained. Then the economic analysis of different hydrogen storage and transportation modes under 1-to-N hydrogen storage and transportation scenario is conducted, which can significantly decrease the cost of LH storage and transportation mode. To step further, the 1-to-N relay hydrogen storage and transportation scenario is constructed to improve the applicability and reduce the unit cost. The economic analysis of 14 kinds of feasible combinations of hydrogen storage and transportation modes is systematically assessed. Regarding to the transportation distance and daily hydrogen demand, the optimal economical 1-to-N relay energy storage and transportation modes are identified.

	abstract = {Internal combustion engine inefficiencies and waste heat emissions raise environmental concerns, as they waste fuel energy in the form of heat, increasing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, waste heat contributes to the urban heat island effect. Waste heat recovery is a vital solution, capturing and repurposing heat to reduce fuel use, emissions, and costs while promoting sustainability, innovation, and economic growth. Polygenerative waste heat recovery maximizes energy efficiency by generating multiple forms of energy from a single source, enhancing overall sustainability. The proposed Trinitor model is a polygenerative system encompassing power generation, product drying, space cooling/heating, and oxygen production. Power generation utilizes exhaust heat stored in a phase change material (PCM) to generate electricity through a Hot Air Turbine. The PCM also stores heat from the PVT thermal collector and supports produce drying. In the space cooling/heating process, the temperature contrast resulting from the hot air generated by the turbine and the cooled air from the Cooling chamber is harnessed by the Seebeck principle within the TEG, converting heat energy into electricity, and it is possible to create temperature variations using the Peltier Effect by supplying electricity. Oxygen production involves dehumidifying air, separating oxygen from hydrogen using an electrolyzer and storing oxygen for civilian use. A component review identifies SiC wall flow-diesel particulate filters (DPF), a paraffin-based Latent Heat Storage System, and electric-assisted turbo compounding as cost-effective for energy production. Produce drying relies on hot air or infrared drying, a revolving wicks humidifier, and a cooling coil dehumidifier. Space cooling/heating needs a water-type PV/T collector, MPPT charge controller, lithium-ion batteries, and ceramic TEGs. A PEM electrolyzer with appropriate components (bipolar plates, electrodes, catalyst, membrane, and gasket) enhances oxygen production efficiency. Based on existing literature, the trinitor has the potential to attain an overall efficiency ranging from 40.12–54.81%. Thus, a combination of low-efficiency processes results in a highly efficient waste heat recovery Trinitor system, with further improvements possible through identified components’ integration. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Because the BOG must be removed through processes such as re-liquefaction, venting to the atmosphere, or incineration, related studies are required to estimate the heat transfer of storage and transport devices and to improve insulation to reduce BOG generation. In this study, a vaporization analysis was performed on a vacuum-jacketed valve used in liquid hydrogen storage and transport devices to calculate the amount of BOG generation considering the flow characteristics at the vena contracta and the saturation temperature. At a pressure of 1 bar in the liquid hydrogen storage tank, the maximum fluid flow velocity and minimum static pressure occurred at the vena contracta, with values of 62.9 m/s and −0.4 bar, respectively, and the BOG generation rate was estimated as 0.132 m3/h, where the saturation temperature was minimized at 19.3 K. Furthermore, through case studies, when the pressure in the liquid hydrogen storage tank increased to 1.5 and 2 bar, the static pressure and saturation temperature decreased, and the BOG generation rate increased to 0.221 and 0.283 m3/h, respectively. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Climate change is the most pressing challenge faced today. Carbon emissions from industry, transport and other forms of energy continue to threaten the future. Industrialised countries are desperately considering running carbon-neutral goals by 2050. Among the strategies under consideration, integrating hydrogen into natural gas streams, known as hydrogen blending with natural gas, has achieved substantial attention from academia, industry, and governmental bodies. This article thoroughly explores the potential of decarbonisation by integrating hydrogen into natural gas networks. It aims to provide valuable insights by addressing challenges, opportunities, and crucial factors influencing hydrogen-natural gas (H2-NG) blends in gas distribution systems. The article covers safety considerations across hydrogen's entire lifecycle, including production, transportation, storage, and utilisation. It also delves into the complex issue of pipeline corrosion, highlighting its significance for structural integrity when dealing with H2-NG blends. Furthermore, the article significantly focuses on hydrogen embrittlement (HE), discussing classifications, mechanisms, consequences, and mitigation strategies within blended gas networks. It also explores developments in pipeline coatings, evaluating their compatibility and efficacy in mitigating HE and corrosion within H2-NG blends. Finally, the study employs bibliometric analysis to guide researchers by drawing insights from existing literature and identifying potential avenues for future progress in H2-NG blending. By addressing the multifaceted aspects of decarbonisation through H2-NG blending, this article aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable energy strategies. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) is being acknowledged as the future energy carrier due to its high energy density and potential to mitigate the intermittency of other renewable energy sources. H2 also ensures a clean, carbon-neutral, and sustainable environment for current and forthcoming generations by contributing to the global missions of decarbonization in the transportation, industrial, and building sectors. Several H2 storage technologies are available and have been employed for its secure and economical transport. The existing H2 storage and transportation technologies like liquid-state, cryogenic, or compressed hydrogen are in use but still suffer from significant challenges regarding successful realization at the commercial level. These factors affect the overall operational cost of technology. Therefore, H2 storage demands novel technologies that are safe for mobility, transportation, long-term storage, and yet it is cost-effective. This review article presents potential opportunities for H2 storage technologies, such as physical and chemical storage. The prime characteristics and requirements of H2 storage are briefly explained. A detailed discussion of chemical-based hydrogen storage systems such as metal hydrides, chemical hydrides (CH3OH, NH3, and HCOOH), and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) is presented.

The paper describes a CFD model able to reproduce the INERIS experiment performed using 12 m3 volume tank when 300 kg of ammonia were vented during 460 s from the ullage through the pipe to the atmosphere. The model is based on the volume-of-fluid method combined with Lee's model for mass transfer between phases. Extensive calibration trials were conducted to examine the impact of surrounding temperature conditions. It allowed to establish the range of time relaxation parameter values of Lee evaporation-condensation model specific for liquid ammonia tank venting. Simulations reproduced accurately the experimentally measured final pressure in the tank and the amount of ammonia released during venting. Liquid ammonia boiling is triggered by reduction of pressure and takes place throughout the liquid causing the pressure recovery phenomenon. Numerical simulations demonstrated that pressure recovery phenomenon is driven by the characteristic time delay associated with the rise of vapour bubbles generated by flash boiling and the subsequent release of evaporated ammonia into the tank ullage space. The developed CFD model can be used as a contemporary tool for safety engineering and development of tank management strategies for liquid ammonia storage. © 2023 The Authors},

These challenges stem from hydrogen's different properties compared to natural gas, such as higher ignition probability, different flame behavior, and potential for hydrogen embrittlement.

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen energy storage (UHES) in lined rock caverns (LRCs) is a promising solution for mitigating the instability of clean energy generation. However, the hydrogen injection/extraction process may activate potential faults surrounding the caverns, jeopardizing the service safety of the lining structures. In this study, a novel polymeric sealing layer was developed and tested for UHES, to replace the traditional steel lining. A numerical model of fault activation was established to analyze the mechanical response of the lining structures under various parameters, such as injection/extraction operation parameters, fault characteristics, and concrete lining forms. Results show that the stress level of the concrete lining is directly related to the number of hydrogen injection/extraction cycles, fault angle, and magnitude, while it diminishes with increasing fault distance. The flexible joint fillers could disperse the circumferential stress and absorb energy continuously during fault activation, resulting in lower stress levels and damage to segmental concrete lining, compared with integral concrete lining. The sealing layer, protected by the concrete lining, experiences lower stress fluctuations during fault activation. Additionally, the results obtained show that a certain distance threshold for fault-induced damage to the concrete lining was identified, beyond which fault activation no longer triggers damage. The distance threshold was tentatively determined to be 20 m. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In a Sieverts apparatus, the poor heat transfer performance of a sample cell leads to inaccuracy in kinetics test of hydrogen storage materials. Consequently, the analysis of heat transfer of the reaction process in the sample cell is essential. However, it is difficult for traditional detection methods to track the physical and chemical dynamic changes in the sample cell. In this paper, the finite element method was used to simulate the reaction process in the sample cell. A two-dimensional numerical model was designed to characterize the hydrogen absorption process in order to investigate the link between the heat transfer performance of the sample cell and the reaction kinetics. It was found that the reaction kinetics would be close to the intrinsic kinetics of the materials as its amount decreased. However, the decreased amount of hydrogen storage materials had a restricted effect on the increase of the reaction rate. The relevant amount of hydrogen storage material was recommended based on the comprehensive analysis of this study. In addition, the improvement of the thermal conductivity of the MH reaction bed and sample cell material improved the heat transfer performance to a certain extent. Finally, the relationship among the amount of hydrogen storage material, thermal conductivity and absorption time was established through the simulation analysis, which provided some schemes for optimizing the reaction kinetics testing accuracy of Sieverts apparatus. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is of great importance to solve the energy crisis and environment pollution, and multiple hydrogen storage methods have been proposed, among which the metal hydrides (MHs) have attracted wide attentions in recent years. Considering the complementary heat demand of MH and fuel cell (FC) during operation, a thermal coupling system (TCS), where part of the heat generated by FC is transferred to MH tank to facilitate the endothermic hydrogen desorption, has been proposed and investigated in the literatures. However, since the heating of MH tank may retard the evolution of FC towards set operation point and decrease the system efficiency, a control strategy with rapid response and high precision is indispensable for the steady and efficient operation of TCS. This study reviews the research status and limitations of TCS classified according to the heat transfer mode, then the control strategies under various application scenarios are discussed and summarized. Furthermore, three crucial technical issues associated with the application of TCS in distributed energy system are highlighted for future investigations. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

We report a kind of highly robust phosphorescent systems, by doping a rigid phosphor into a copolymer (polyvinyl butyral resin) matrix with a balance of mutually exclusive features, including a rigidly hydrophilic hydrogen bond network and elastically hydrophobic constituent. Impressively, these RTP polymeric films have superior adhesive ability on various surfaces and showed reversible photoactivated RTP with lifetimes up to 5.82 seconds, which can be used as in situ modulated anticounterfeit labels. They can maintain a bright afterglow for over 25.0 seconds under various practical conditions, such as storage in refrigerators, soaking in natural water for a month, or even being subjected to strong collisions and impacts. These findings provide deep insights for developing stable ultralong RTP materials with desirable comprehensive performance. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The transition to a low-carbon energy system can be depicted as a “great reconfiguration” from a socio-technical perspective that carries the risk of impact shifts. Electrification with the objective of achieving rapidly deep decarbonisation must be accompanied by effective efficiency and flexibility measures. Hydrogen can be a preferred option in the decarbonisation process where electrification of end-uses is difficult or impractical as well as for long-term storage in energy infrastructure characterised by a large penetration of renewable energy sources. Notwithstanding the current uncertainties regarding costs, environmental impact and the inherent difficulties of increasing rapidly supply capacity, hydrogen can represent a solution to be used in multi-energy systems with combined heat and power (CHP), in particular in urban energy districts. In fact, while achieving carbon savings with natural gas fuelled CHP is not possible when low grid carbon intensity factors are present, it may still be possible to use it to provide flexibility services and to reduce emissions further with switch from natural gas to hydrogen. In this paper, a commercially established urban district energy scheme located in Southampton (United Kingdom) is analysed with the goal of exploring potential variations in its energy demand. The study proposes the use of scalable data-driven methods and probabilistic simulation to generate seasonal energy demand patterns representing the potential short-term and long-term evolution of the energy district. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {A green hydrogen (H2) economy requires a sustainable, efficient, safe, and widespread infrastructure for transporting and distributing H2 from production to consumption sites. Transporting a hydrogen/natural gas (H2NG) mixture, including pure H2, through the existing European natural gas (NG) infrastructure is considered a cost-effective solution, particularly in the transitional phase. Several reasons justify the H2NG blending option. The NG infrastructure can be efficiently repurposed to transport H2, by blending H2 with NG, to operate as H2 daily storage, matching production and demand and to enable large-scale seasonal H2 storage. Although many benefits exist, the potential of existing NG grids for transporting and distributing green H2 may face limitations due to technical, economic, or normative concerns. This paper focuses on the state of the art of the European NG transmission and distribution metrology normative framework and identifies the gaps to be filled in case of H2NG flowing into the existing grids. The paper was revised to provide a comprehensive analysis of the practical implications resulting from the H2NG blend option. © 2024 The Authors},

This gaseous mixture is then employed for exothermic ammonia synthesis, releasing energy for a continuous thermal power cycle. This study focuses on the optimal design of a novel ammonia synthesis process, which uses absorption for ammonia separation instead of condensation, for solar thermochemical energy recovery. A comprehensive first-principles model of the system, encompassing ammonia synthesis and absorption, heat exchange, and gas compression and storage, was developed. An optimization problem was formulated considering standard materials and design constraints, and a nested optimization/simulation approach was employed to integrate the transient absorption behavior with steady-state design. The results provide optimal dimensions and operating conditions for all process units, minimizing the total capital cost. Various operating pressures were examined, revealing minimal differences among the optimal results. The proposed absorbent-enhanced ammonia synthesis process can heat supercritical steam from 350 to 720 °C, producing approximately 40.6 MWt with discharging and exergetic efficiencies of around 85 and 25%, respectively. Given that the storage tank is the most expensive unit, it was replaced with underground storage, resulting in a levelized cost of heat of about 1.6 ¢/kWht. The case study findings highlight the potential of utilizing ammonia absorption in an ammonia-based thermochemical energy storage system. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the possibility of hydrogen storage in depleted gas reservoirs, natural gas storage facilities, aquifers and salt caverns, the applicability of ferritic pearlitic K55 and tempered martensitic L80, both very frequently used as casings and tubings, has been investigated. Materials were investigated by means of high-pressure, high-temperature autoclave tests and analyses of the hydrogen uptake. The autoclave tests were performed on tensile specimens loaded with a spring at 90 % of the specified minimum yield strength, additionally the samples were analysed to determine the hydrogen uptake. Different gas compositions were considered (pure hydrogen, with or without the presence of CO2/H2S) under a hydrogen partial pressure of 120 bar. The tests were conducted in dry or wet environments. From the results, it can be seen that the hydrogen uptake is low even under the most severe conditions. However, from the mechanical test conducted in this study, it appears that the ferritic pearlitic K55 steel seems to be a suitable pipe material for underground hydrogen storage, and the higher strength steel L80 steel can be used only in non-sour environments (no significant amount of H2S in the reservoir, which is a priori the case of underground storages). © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Hydrogen obtained from renewable sources such as water and alcohols is regarded as an efficient clean-burning alternative to non-renewable fuels. The use of the so-called bio-H2 regardless of its colour will be a significant step towards achieving global net-zero carbon goals. Challenges still persist however with conventional H2 storage, which include low-storage density and high cost of transportation apart from safety concerns. Global efforts have thus focussed on liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), which have shown excellent potential for H2 storage while allowing safer large-scale transformation and easy on-site H2 generation. While water could be considered as the most convenient liquid inorganic hydrogen carrier (LIHC) on a long-term basis, the utilization of alcohols as LOHCs to generate on-demand H2 has tasted instant success. This has helped to draw a road-map of futuristic H2 storage and transportation. The current review brings to the fore the state-of-the-art developments in hydrogen generation from readily available, feed-agnostic bio-alcohols as LOHCs using molecular transition-metal catalysts. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Transition metal layered double hydroxides have extremely high specific capacitances but suffer from poor rate performance and cycling stability due to their low conductivity and structural stability. In this study, cobalt-coordinated carbon quantum dots (CoCQDs) were designed and synthesized to enhance the energy storage performance of nickel–cobalt layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDH). Nickel and cobalt ions were co-electrodeposited with the CoCQDs to form a NiCo-LDH based composite electrode (denoted as CoC@LDH). Since the CoCQDs participated in the formation of the NiCo-LDH, the carbon quantum dots could be strongly bonded to the NiCo-LDH nanosheets through coordination interactions. Thus, the conductivity as well as the structure stability of the NiCo-LDH was effectively improved, which greatly boosted the cycle stability and rate performance of the NiCo-LDH. Several CoCQDs with different Co contents (nCoCQDs, n = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0) were fabricated and their effects on the performance of the resultant electrodes nCoC@LDH were investigated. The 1.0CoC@LDH electrode exhibited an impressive specific capacitance of 1867 F g–1 at 1 A-g–1, along with a significantly enhanced capacitance retention of 84.6 % after 6000 cycles at 5 A g–1 (benchmark 49.5 %). This ingenious design provides a new avenue for fabricating pseudo-capacitive materials with unprecedented high performance. © 2023},

Two mathematical models, namely, the species transport model and the multiphase mixture model, are commonly used to describe the stratification phenomena of HENG. To evaluate the suitability of both models in simulating the stratification phenomena of HENG, the model accuracy was initially validated by comparing with published experimental data. Subsequently, the spontaneous concentration distribution trend in a binary gas mixture (hydrogen + methane) system within an enclosed space is analyzed based on the principles of minimum energy. The findings indicate that the species transport model is more suitable for describing the distribution of HENG in enclosed spaces; the HENG mixture gradually attains uniform concentration distribution when it remains static and eventually reaches equilibrium without any obvious concentration stratification. This study aims at offering valuable insights for ensuring safe transportation and storage of HENG. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Focusing on expanding and maturing the technology of excavated waste-to-energy pathways can promise a renewable energy production process in addition to reducing land occupation and greenhouse gas emissions. A very scarce comprehensive literature had covered the exergetic performance, life cycle analysis, and financial feasibility of hydrogen-from-excavated-waste technologies based on the plasma gasification process. This article aims to provide a comprehensive comparison under the exergy, techno-economic, and life cycle environmental analyses for two different hydrogen-from-excavated waste pathways. In this regard, two different configurations (under an innovative methodological and analytical approaches) have been proposed for conceptual design and comparative study of hydrogen fuel generation from excavated waste based on plasma gasification, sorption enhanced/gas-water shift, and gas-water shift processes. The techno-economic and life cycle environmental analyses were compared at two levels (i.e., refuse derived fuel-to-hydrogen and excavated waste-to-hydrogen pathways), which had not been reported in most of the literature. From the outcomes, the proposed excavated waste-to-hydrogen process integrated with the carbon dioxide capture and storage process can provide superior environmental (especially in terms of impacts on human health) and thermodynamic performances compared to the standalone-plasma gasification process. Furthermore, the financial feasibility of the proposed project is completely affected by the selling price of hydrogen.

	abstract = {The efficient operation of a metal hydride based hydrogen storage system primarily depends on the configuration of the storage reactor. Both the total weight and effective performance are crucial for large capacity hydrogen storage systems. Therefore, the present work is centered around the development of a lightweight, compact, and efficient MH reactor capable of accommodating a large hydrogen inventory. In this perspective, a disc finned multi tube reactor (DFMTR) design is proposed, and its behaviour is numerically analyzed. Five reactor configurations are studied using 3D COMSOL modeling to visualize the impact of various fin structures during the absorption and desorption half cycles. The DFMTR model shows remarkably higher performance by saving 38% and 31% time to store and release hydrogen compared to the baseline reactor. Further, the design methodology is discussed, and the geometrical and operational parameters are optimized to achieve the excellent performance of the proposed reactor. Furthermore, the portable design approach for scaling up the capacity of the storage system is discussed and recommended. Moreover, the proposed reactor design is compared with recent studies of the literature, and found that this reactor saved 22.1%, 50%, 52.1%, and 8.7% of time to store 90% hydrogen compared with tapered finned multi tube reactor, tube bundle reactor, radial finned reactor, and pin fin reactor, respectively. The authors believe that the proposed large capacity reactor has the potential to deliver outstanding performance, and this research will be instrumental in the construction of compact, effective metal hydride reactors with significant hydrogen storage capacities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {To reduce carbon emissions, generation of electricity from combustion systems is being replaced by renewable resources. However, the most abundant renewable sources – solar and wind – are not dispatchable, vary diurnally and are subject to intermittency, and produce electricity at times in excess of demand (excess production). To manage this variability and capture the excess renewable energy, energy storage technologies are being developed and deployed such as battery energy storage (BES), hydrogen production with electrolyzers (ELY) paired with hydrogen energy storage (HES) and fuel cells (FCs), and renewable natural gas (RNG) production. While BES may be better suited for short duration storage, hydrogen is suited for long duration storage and RNG can decarbonize the natural gas system. California Senate Bill 100 (SB100) sets a goal that all retail electricity sold in the State must be sourced from renewable and zero-carbon resources by 2045, raising the questions of which set of technologies and in what proportion are required to meet the 2045 target in the required timeframe as well as the role of the natural gas infrastructure, if any. To address these questions, this study combines electric grid dispatch modeling and optimization to identify the energy storage and dispatchable technologies in 5-year increments from 2030 to 2045 required to transition from a 60% renewable electric grid in 2035 to a 100% renewable electric grid in 2045. The results show that, by utilizing the established natural gas system to store and transmit hydrogen and RNG, the deployment of battery energy storage is dramatically reduced. The required capacity for BES in 2045, for example, is 40 times lower by leveraging the natural gas infrastructure with a concomitant reduction in cost and associated challenges to transform the electric grid. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Accurately measuring and analyzing the effective thermal conductivity of metal hydride beds is critical to design the structure of solid-state hydrogen storage tanks. On the basis of the steady-state radial heat flow method, a measurement cell of effective thermal conductivity was manufactured. The effective thermal conductivities of nonactivated and activated LaNi5 powder beds were measured in helium, nitrogen, and argon atmospheres with the temperature changing from 20 to 60 °C and pressure from 0.1 to 4.0 MPa. Then, the effective thermal conductivities were further analyzed using the Zehner–Schlünder–Damköhler model. Results show that the effective thermal conductivities can be enhanced by increasing gas thermal conductivity, gas pressure, and bed temperature. In addition, the effective thermal conductivities can be accurately predicted using the modified Zehner–Schlünder–Damköhler model considering the Smoluchowski effect (error < ± 5 %). With the use of the modified Zehner–Schlünder–Damköhler model, the contributions of different heat transfer pathways to the entire heat transfer of LaNi5 powder beds were analyzed. Approximately 70 %–91 % of the effective thermal conductivity of LaNi5 powder beds is contributed by the conduction of the particle–gas–particle pathway. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sand production, a challenge in the geo-energy industry, compromises reservoir integrity and equipment by eroding and transporting sand grains from unconsolidated and weakly consolidated reservoirs, which is crucial in oil, gas, geothermal, and underground hydrogen storage systems. Effective management and accurate prediction of sand behaviors are essential for maintaining wellbore stability and optimizing energy extraction processes. This study comprehensively reviews the discrete element method (DEM) used over the past three decades for simulating sand production, a significant phenomenon causing substantial equipment damage and financial losses in the geo-energy industry. Our review elaborates on the adaptation of DEM for modeling the mechanical behavior of sandstone, sandy materials, and granular packs, which is essential for predicting and mitigating sand production. We categorize the review into five key areas—force models, bond models, damping models, particle shape, and particle size distribution. These aspects are pivotal in enhancing the realism of DEM simulations. The review critically assesses current methodologies and their limitations, emphasizing the need for precise parameter selection in DEM to yield realistic simulations, aligning with the emerging trends and technological advancements in geotechnical engineering. © 2023},

The FEA results were compared with the experimental data from a previous study. Good agreement between the FEA simulation and experimental results was obtained. Geometrical parameter and packing fraction exploration was carried out to predict wall deformation induced and to evaluate the performance of such MH alloy vessels under long-term cyclic hydrogenation-dehydrogenation. Numerical results indicated that the hoop stresses induced increase with the numbers of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation cycles, packing fraction, and slenderness ratio of MH storage vessels. The largest deformation tends to concentrate at the bottom of vessels caused by the progressive pulverization and agglomeration mechanism. With a packing fraction of 70 %, the hoop stresses induced tend to increase to a saturation point after 60 hydrogenation-dehydrogenation cycles correlated with the saturated densification of MH alloy powders. It was found that the packing fraction and slenderness ratio (h/d) should be maintained lower than values of 60 % and 3.3, respectively, in order to assure safety performance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to its unique chemical structure, hydrogen energy inherently has a high calorific value without reinforcing global warming, so it is expected to be a promising alternative energy source in the future. In this work, we focus on nanoconfined hydrogen flow performance, a critical issue in terms of geological hydrogen storage. For nanopores where the pore scale is comparable to hydrogen’s molecular size, the impact on hydrogen molecules exerted by the pore surface cannot be neglected, leading to the molecules near the surface gaining mobility and slipping on the surface. Furthermore, hydrogen adsorption takes place in the nanopores, and the way the adsorption molecules move is completely different from the bulk molecules. Hence, the frequently applied Navier–Stokes equation, based on the no-slip boundary condition and overlooking the contribution of the adsorption molecules, fails to precisely predict the hydrogen flow capacity in nanopores. In this paper, hydrogen molecules are classified as bulk molecules and adsorption molecules, and then models for the bulk hydrogen and the adsorption hydrogen are developed separately. In detail, the bulk hydrogen model considers the slip boundary and rarefaction effect characterized by the Knudsen number, while the flow of the adsorption hydrogen is driven by a chemical potential gradient, which is a function of pressure and the essential adsorption capacity. Subsequently, a general model for the hydrogen flow in nanopores is established through weight superposition of the bulk hydrogen flow as well as the adsorption hydrogen, and the key weight coefficients are determined according to the volume proportion of the identified area. The results indicate that (a) the surface diffusion of the adsorption molecules dominates the hydrogen flow capacity inside nanopores with a pore size of less than 5 nm; (b) improving the pressure benefits the bulk hydrogen flow and plays a detrimental role in reducing surface diffusion at a relatively large pressure range; (c) the nanoconfined hydrogen flow conductance with a strong adsorption capacity (PL = 2 MPa) could reach a value ten times greater than that with a weak adsorption capacity (PL = 10 MPa). This research provides a profound framework for exploring hydrogen flow behavior in ultra-tight strata related to adsorption phenomena. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Ammonia allows for long-distance and large-scale storage transport of renewable energy sources. The reactivity of NH3-Air flame can be enhanced by doping with hydrogen and by increasing the initial temperature. The flame combustion characteristics of NH3–H2-Air are studied in a rectangular closed pipe with a mole fraction of 45% H2, an equivalence ratio (φ) of 0.8–1.2 and 0.1 MPa. The initial temperatures (Tu) of the mixture are 300 K, 375 K and 450 K. Experimental studies of flame front speed, flame tip structure evolution, and overpressure dynamics are performed. Laminar burning velocity (SL), peak mole fraction of key radicals, and flame instability of NH3–H2-Air flames are simulated in Chemkin Pro-software using the Mathieu and Petersen mechanism. The results show that the relatively low equivalence ratio and initial temperature promote the structural changes of the flame tip, forming a “tulip” flame and a distorted “tulip”. As the equivalence ratio increases, the flame front speed and overpressure increase and the flame oscillates slightly. The distortion in the lip of the “tulip” is more pronounced. The increase in temperature promotes flame propagation in the early stages and the pressure decreases. Reactive activity increases with increasing temperature, the peak mole fraction of NH2 and H radicals increases, and SL increases. At normal temperature, the flame is affected by thermo-diffusive instability only when lean mixture. The Darrieus-Landau instability increases as the equivalence ratio increases. Conversely, the Darrieus-Landau instability decreases with increasing temperature. Therefore, the current experimental and simulation results help to understand the laminar combustion characteristics of NH3–H2-Air at high temperatures. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Considering the necessity for compact hydrogen storage system for fuel cell stacks, 41 embedded cooling tube (ECT) reactor with an outer cooling jacket (OCJ) is designed, fabricated and tested with 3.75 kg of LCC1® alloy. To analyse the sensitivity of the system performance at various operating conditions and the applicability of this prototype as storage system, an extensive parametric investigation was carried out at varying supply pressure (Ps), absorption temperature (Ta) and desorption temperature (Td). LCC1® alloy achieved maximum hydrogen storage capacity (HSC) of 1.6 wt% within 420 s at Ps of 25 bar, Ta of 25 °C and heat transfer fluid (HTF) flow rate (HTFa) of 6 LPM. Supply pressure is found to have greater influence than absorption temperature over absorption performance and heating output. With Ta of 25 °C, HTFa of 6 LPM, HSC of 1.58 wt% and 1.6 wt% were achieved at Ps of 20 bar and 30 bar, respectively, resulting in corresponding specific heating power (SHP) of 497.7 W/kg and 544.9 W/kg. Varying Ta from 25 °C to 35 °C at Ps of 20 bar and HTFa of 6 LPM resulted in 3% reduction in HSC. During desorption, desorption temperature of above 20 °C is found to be favourable with more than 95% of stored hydrogen being desorbed. It is further observed that the dehydriding rate of LCC1® was nearly steady which is potentially suitable for fuel cell applications, as the average dehydriding rate is estimated to be about 15.75 NLPM and 22.91 NLPM at Td of 20 °C and 25 °C, respectively, with 6 LPM of HTF flow rate. The analysed module is proposed as a potential hydrogen supply unit for a 1 kW fuel cell reported in literature. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {As one of the most promising renewable energy sources, hydrogen has the excellent environmental benefit of producing zero emissions. A key technical challenge in using hydrogen across sectors is placed on its storage technology. The storage temperature of liquid hydrogen (20 K, or −253 °C) is close to absolute zero so the storage materials and the insulation layers are subjected to extremely stringent requirements against the cryogenic behaviour of the medium. In this context, this research proposed to design a large liquid hydrogen type-C tank with AISI (American Iron and Steel Institution) type 316 L stainless steel as the metal barrier, using Vapor-Cooled Shield (VCS) and Rigid Polyurethane Foams (RPF) as the insulation layer. A parametric study on the design of the insulation layer was carried out by establishing a thermodynamic model. The effects of VCS location on heat ingress to the liquid hydrogen transport tank and insulation temperature distribution were investigated, and the optimal location of the VCS in the insulation was identified. Research outcomes finally suggest two optimal design schemes: (1) when the thickness of the insulation layer is determined, Self-evaporation Vapor-Cooled Shield (SVCS) and Forced-evaporation Vapor-Cooled Shield (FVCS) can reduce heat transfer by 47.84% and 85.86% respectively; (2) when the liquid hydrogen evaporation capacity is determined, SVCS and FVCS can reduce the thickness of the insulation layer by 50% and 67.93% respectively. © 2023},

	abstract = {The extremely high energy density and carbon-free characteristics of liquid hydrogen (LH2) make it suitable for replacing liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a future energy commodity. However, the extremely low evaporation temperature of LH2 results in high heat leakage. Multilayer insulation (MLI), which is the most thermally efficient insulation system known, is widely used in the fields of hydrogen energy, aerospace, and other cryogenic fields. Variable density multilayer insulation (VDMLI), which has emerged in the last two decades, has improved the performance of MLI by adding spacers to change the density of MLI. However, there has been no significant progress in the optimization theory for VDMLI. In this paper, based on the layer by layer model and the Lockheed equation, a generalized optimal layer density calculation model for VDMLI is established by considering the influences of spacers, compressive pressure, gas pressure, etc. The results indicate that compared to general VDMLI and MLI on liquid hydrogen tanks, the optimal layer density VDMLI (OVDMLI) can reduce heat leakage by 21.1% and 25.3%, respectively. After comparison and analysis, the characteristics and reasons for temperature and heat transfer conductivity profiles of MLI, VDMLI, and OVDMLI are pointed out. The effect of the spacer number on heat flux and spacer profile is analyzed. Additionally, gas pressure profile and heat transfer are investigated with consideration given to the vacuum degree at both boundaries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

First, the k-shorted path method is introduced to analyze HFCV refueling load considering vehicle travel habits and routing diversity. Second, based on it, a two-stage integrated planning model is established to minimize the total investment and operation cost. The construction of hydrogen refueling stations, electrolysis-based hydrogen generation stations and hydrogen pipelines are coordinated with their operating constraints, constituting the green hydrogen supply chain, in which hydrogen storage is also an important part for consideration to address variable renewable power. Then, the proposed model is reformulated as a mixed integer linear programing (MILP) problem solved efficiently. Finally, the case studies are carried out on an urban area in Xi'an China to verify the validity and correctness of the proposed method. The results show that the integrated planning can realize synergy benefits. The influence of electricity prices and k values is also discussed. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Type-I, III, and IV high-pressure tanks, adsorbent storage, metal hydride storage and chemical storage options are investigated and compared based on their hydrogen storage capacities, costs, masses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results of this study show that in a Type-IV hydrogen storage tank (i.e., composite material tank of carbon fiber with thermoplastic polymer liners), increasing the tank pressure from 100 bar to 800 bar increases the hydrogen holding capacity by 457.7%. Regarding the environmental impact, the lowest GHG emissions appear to be the lowest for liquid hydrogen storage with an average of 3.5 CO2eq/kg-H2 while the respective emissions become the highest in metal hydride storage tanks as 113.6 CO2eq/kg-H2. Furthermore, hydrogen storage capacity for Type-IV tanks varies from 1.94 kg at 100 bar to 15.69 kg at 1500 bar in a 250 L tank. In chemical hydride storage tanks, the stored H2 mass will be 40.75 kg for 100 L, 128.39 kg for 200 L, 216.03 kg for 300 L, 303.67 kg for 400 L, 391.31 kg for 500 L and 478.96 kg for 600 L, respectively.

The drill string collides violently with the wellbore reduces the wellbore quality and increases the unreliability of the HUS. Lateral harmonic response has the greatest damage to well wall. Torsional harmonic response causes less damage than lateral vibration. High WOB (weight on bit) and high RPM (rotary per minute) are not conducive to the quality of HUS.

	abstract = {The conversion process from parahydrogen to orthohydrogen accompanies an endothermic effect. Embedment of a para-ortho hydrogen converter into the thermal insulation could enhance the thermal protection of a liquid hydrogen storage tank. A physical model was proposed to simulate the heat transfer behavior of the insulation structure that integrates a polyurethane foam, a blanket of multilayer insulation, a vapor-cooled shield, and a para-ortho hydrogen converter. The effect of the para-ortho conversion process was considered. The model was validated by experimental data and then used to investigate how the para-ortho hydrogen conversion influences the temperature distribution inside the composite insulation. It was found that a single converter improves the cooling performance most effectively if it is placed at the middle length of the venting pipe mounted on the vapor-cooled shield. Either incorporating more converters or extending the length of the vapor-cooled shield pipes brings limited further improvement. The optimum position of the vapor-cooled shield inside the multilayer insulation moves towards the cold boundary in the presence of para-ortho conversion, compared to conventional vapor-cooled shield and multilayer insulation structures. A net heat flux reduction of over 10% could be achieved when the para-ortho conversion is located at the optimal position inside the vapor-cooled shield. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In this article, the absorption and desorption performance of a multi-tubular hydride reactor is numerically investigated and optimized for 60 kg mass of LaNi5 alloy. The 90% absorption with 7, 14, and 19 tubes is achieved in 985, 404, and 317 s with an overall reactor weight of 78.46, 88, and 88.2 kg, respectively. The 14-tube reactor performance is investigated by introducing the longitudinal fins inside the tubes. The reactor performance is enhanced by allocating fins into different pairs of half and full fins constrained by overall fin volume. A thermal resistance network model is presented to investigate the effect of fin distribution and coolant velocity on equivalent resistance of the metal hydride reactor. Storage performance obtained from numerical model validates the thermal resistance analysis from heat transfer viewpoint. With six full fins, 90% hydrogen absorption is achieved in 76 s. However, tubes with 6, 8, and 12 pairs of half and full fins require 74, 58, and 54 s, respectively. The 14-tube reactor with 8 pairs of half and full fins is used for quantifying the augmentation in the absorption performance in response to operating conditions (supply pressure and heat transfer fluid temperature).

	abstract = {It is a challenging task to predict and analyse the transient flow physics in unconventional complex geological formations such as coal seams. This is due to the multi-scale multi-physics nature of processes taking place in coal seam gas reservoirs. Therefore, numerical tools allowing the incorporation of various flow physics inherent to coal into the simulation routine are of particular importance. At the pore-scale, the rock images obtained by micro-computed tomography are frequently used for flow modelling in porous or fractured media by direct numerical simulations (Lattice Boltzman method or by solving Navier Stokes equations) or by utilising so-called pore-network modelling. Both methods have advantages and drawbacks, while their hybridisation may allow us avoid some of the major pitfalls. Due to a limited number of research dedicated to image-based pore-scale modelling in coal, we develop a hybrid numerical model that combines the Hagen-Poiseuille analytical solution and the volume of fluid advection scheme for fluid flow in fractures with the continuum Darcy flow in the coal matrix. The explicit coupling of fluid flow across the fracture-matrix domains is implemented via corresponding source terms in the governing equations. Besides, additional physics including sorption and matrix swelling-shrinkage phenomena are introduced into the numerical model. The hybrid solver is validated against analytical solutions and a previously developed Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes framework, which has similar functionality for modelling fluid flow in coal seams. To validate the developed model and show its capability to capture multi-scale multi-physics flow in coal, several illustrative simulations are conducted using synthetic and realistic digital images of coal. As a result, the accuracy of the hybrid solver was within 4% when compared to the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes framework for flow simulation on realistic geometry. Besides, the non-parallelised hybrid model outperformed the parallelised direct numerical simulation, being more than 90 times faster in terms of computational time.

	abstract = {Green hydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising candidates to combat the global energy crisis because of its high energy density, sustainability and abundance on earth. Large-scale green H2 ecosystems that empower the global transition towards a carbon–neutral energy society are highly desired, yet challenging, to be deployed. Limitations such as relatively low production and storage efficiencies from renewable technologies, high transportation and utilization costs and safety concerns regarding H2 handling greatly restrain the development of green H2 ecosystems. Revolutions in materials science and technology are crucial to tackle these issues and construct practical green H2 ecosystems. Though reviews focus exclusively on the material development in individual sectors of the H2 ecosystem, they lack a review focusing on the material challenges and advances in the green H2 ecosystem in a comprehensive and instructive manner. It is pivotal to providing constructive and universal solutions for common material challenges in green H2 technologies, bringing together efforts from all relevant fields and exploring new opportunities and breakthroughs. Herein, this review features cutting-edge material advances and identifies the critical material challenges throughout the entire green H2 ecosystem, including renewable H2 production, purification, storage, transportation, application and safety and cost management. Promising strategies proposed in material progress in the past five years are analyzed to address the material challenges and provide practical and goal-oriented approaches to the material revolution in green H2-related technologies. In-depth insights into cost management are also covered in this review to inspire the translation of advances in materials science into practical large-scale green H2 ecosystems. This is the very first comprehensive and goal-oriented review that presents an overall picture of the entire green H2 ecosystem, as well as the role and specific material requirements and advancement in each part of the ecosystem. In this way, this review will identify the current bottlenecks or fundamental challenges that require urgent breakthroughs in the entire green H2 ecosystem instead of focusing on a particular part so that more effort can be directed to those directions to achieve fast advancement. It will pave the way for building up a green and sustainable H2 economy in the near future. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Recently, the utilization of phase change materials (PCM) for the heat storage/recovery of the metal hydride's reaction heat has received increasing attention. However, the poor heat management process makes hydrogen sorption very slow during heat recycling. In this work, the H2 charging/discharging performance of a metal hydride tank (MHT) filled with LaNi5 and equipped with a paraffin-based (RT35) PCM finned jacket as a passive heat management medium is numerically investigated. Using a two-dimensional mathematical model validated with our in-house experiments, the effects of design parameters such as PCM thermophysical properties and the fin size on hydrogen charging/discharging times of the MHT are investigated systematically. The results showed that the PCM's melting point and apparent heat capacity have a conflicting impact on the hydrogen sorption times, i.e., the low melting point and high specific heat capacity reduce the H2 charging time. In contrast, the hydrogen discharging time follows the opposite trend. As a result, a multi-objective optimization was conducted to simultaneously minimize the H2 charging/discharging times using the thermal properties and size of the PCM. The optimum solutions selected from the Pareto front show that the PCM melting point should be around 42–43 °C for fixed hydrogen ab/desorption pressures of 10/1.5 bar. Moreover, the comparison between the MHT-PCM using the optimized PCM and reference PCM showed that the former reduced the hydrogen charging/discharging times by 48.6 % and 4 %, respectively. At the same time, the hydrogen storage efficiency of the optimal design is 100 % as compared to 96 % for the reference design. Besides, among the practical PCMs, inorganic PCMs (salt hydrates and eutectics) display favorable hydrogen charging time below 3000 s at the expense of hydrogen discharging time (above 7000 s) in our case study. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Polyetherimide (PEI) is the state-of-the-art commercial high-temperature polymer dielectric with excellent thermal and chemical stability and relatively high high-temperature capacitive energy storage properties. The rotation of the dipoles in the PEI chains brings the β-relaxation which seriously increases the leakage current and decreases the charge-discharge efficiency. In this work, hydrogen bonds have been introduced to limit the dipole rotation of PEI by blending aramids [1,4-poly(ether fluoromethyl naphthalene amide), PNFA] into the PEI matrix. By introducing 10 wt % PNFA, the β-relaxation of the blend has been significantly reduced which could be observed from the dielectric spectrum. To explore the mechanism of limited β-relaxation, we analyze the hydrogen bonds in the blend films by infrared spectroscopy and found that the maximum content of hydrogen-bonded carbonyl formed between PNFA and PEI chains was 14.3% when the content of PNFA was 30 wt %. The content of hydrogen bonds formed between PNFA and PEI was positively correlated with the energy storage performance of the blends. The maximum discharged energy density with an efficiency above 90% of the blend film with 30 wt % PNFA reaches 4.1 J cm-3 at 150 °C, which is about 350% higher than that of pristine PEI. This work shows that composing hydrogen bonds by the blending method could be a viable strategy for enhancing the high-temperature energy storage performance of polymer dielectrics, which could be achieved by large-scale preparation and has feasible industrial production prospects. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The deformation and dynamic response of a multilayer cylindrical shell composed of an inner shell and fourteen outer layers under external blast loads of different trinitro-Toluene equivalency weights were studied. A numerical model using the thermo-viscoplastic constitutive model and considering fluid structure coupling between explosion wave and structure was developed. The displacement in axial direction and cross section, as well as the effective strain responses, were analyzed to demonstrate the potential deformation of the shell structure. Results demonstrate that different materials cause inconsistent displacement and separation to develop in the inner and outer shells. In order to address the problem that the displacement of the inner shell is hard to measure due to the shielding and covering of the outer shell, a theoretical formula for calculating the maximum displacement of the inner shell was developed. The deflection process and stress triaxiality histories of the inner shell were investigated, and the results showed that compressive stress is the primary cause of plastic deformation. Additionally, the delamination that appeared in the outer shell was discussed, and it was revealed that there are two factors of delamination: (1) Stress waves spread across adjacent layers in the opposite direction because steel belts were wound in the opposite direction between the two adjacent layers; (2) Outer layers experienced uneven compressive loads. The results will be helpful to provide a reference for the intrinsic safety design of such multilayer cylindrical structures for hydrogen storage, etc. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

	abstract = {Recently, interest in developing H2 strategies with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies has surged. Considering that, this paper reviews recent literature on blue H2, a potential low-carbon, short-term solution during the H2 transition period. Three key aspects were the focus of this paper. First, it presents the processes used for blue H2 production. Second, it presents a detailed comparison between blue H2 and natural gas as fuels and energy carriers. The third aspect focuses on CO2 sequestration in depleted natural gas reservoirs, an essential step for implementing blue H2. Globally, ∼ 75% of H2 is produced using steam methane reforming, which requires CCS to obtain blue H2. Currently, blue H2 needs to compete with other advancing technologies such as green H2, solar power, battery storage, etc. Compared to natural gas and liquefied natural gas, blue H2 gas results in lower CO2 emissions since CCS is applied. However, transporting liquefied and compressed blue H2 entails higher energy, economic, and environmental costs. CCS must be appropriately implemented to produce blue H2 successfully. Due to their established capacity to trap hydrocarbons over geologic time scales, depleted natural gas reservoirs are regarded as a viable option for CCS. Such a conclusion is supported by several simulation studies and field projects in many countries. Additionally, there is much field experience and knowledge on the injection and production performance of natural gas reservoirs. Therefore, using the existing site infrastructure, converting these formations into storage reservoirs is undemanding. © 2023 The Authors},

Subsequently, the transportation framework for hydrogen is discussed. Moreover, the industrial application of hydrogen is elucidated and the existing hydrogen storage systems are chronologically analyzed. From the review of the literature, photocatalytic water splitting technology is the most environmentally benign method available for H2 production. Additionally, underground hydrogen storage in a geologic porous medium offers the largest and most affordable storage capacity for H2 gas. Nonetheless, the compatibility of H2 with reservoir fluid in porous media and other safety concerns has to be adequately understood to avoid preventable losses.

	abstract = {Stainless steel is a common material for high-pressured hydrogen storage. However, the extreme pressure reached in these storage systems accelerates the embrittlement of stainless steel caused by hydrogen, thus reducing its lifetime and seriously limiting the development of the hydrogen industry. Adding hydrogen permeation barrier coatings to the surface of stainless steel is one of the most effective approaches to delay or prevent the permeation of hydrogen and its isotopes through the substrate. Despite the relevance of the issue, studies on hydrogen permeation barrier coating materials have not so far been as popular as those on hydrogen storage materials. In this review, the mechanism of hydrogen permeation and the working principle of hydrogen barriers were investigated. On the basis of this, the hydrogen barring coatings were classified, the influence factors and defects of the coatings were analyzed, and the preparation technologies along with the methods of evaluation were summarized. Polymer composites strengthened by graphene and other materials were considered more competitive due to their cost effectiveness, better compactivity, and potential for mass production.

	abstract = {Hydride-based systems are a potential alternative to hydrogen storage technologies due to their simple structure and ambient operating conditions. The optimization of hydride reactor design factors is highly correlated to the targeted application. This research focuses on optimizing the thermal-static performance of LaNi5-holding helically coiled hydride reactors employing combined response surface methodology, computational modeling, and a desirability approach. The structural geometric design optimization factors include the diameter of the helical tubes and shell, the number of helical tubes, the pitch, and the distance between two adjacent helical tubes. Responses comprise a dimensionless characteristic response – weight ratio (static performance) and 90 % absorption time with maximal heat extraction rate (thermal performance). The quadratic regression model outperformed the linear regression models in terms of accuracy and reliability, effectively reducing the number of computational runs by 83 % compared to the standard parametric study-based technique. Combinatorically assessing the weight ratio and thermal power to be set to the maximum at the quickest absorption time resulted in selecting the best helical reactor design. The optimal base case was further improvised by integrating fins, which were optimized using the proposed methodology. The optimal base case and finned helical reactor subjected to sensitivity analysis revealed that the latter exhibited an average 18 % fall in complete saturation time and a 16 % rise in thermal power despite the 5.66 % loss in weight ratio. The Levelized cost of hydrogen storage was substantially reduced by 18–23 % when operated at higher supply pressures and fluid inlet temperatures. Besides, when the price of the finned reactor to its base case ratio was cut from 1.5 to 1.1, the optimized finned reactor turned economical. Furthermore, the outcomes of a systematic literature comparative study demonstrated that the constructed finned helical reactor was superior to its equivalent, accounting for a 60–75 % drop in 90 % saturation time. As an upshot, this study aids the researchers in designing accurate and apt objective-based hydride reactors using the proposed statistical method: coupled quadratic regression-thermal modeling-desirability approach-based design optimization. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels and is extensively used in process industries. The transportation industry is gearing up towards the use of fuel cells where hydrogen, as a fuel, plays a major role. Irrespective of the application/sector, safe handling and storage of hydrogen are crucial. Storing hydrogen in metal cylinders as compressed gas is a common practice. However, hydrogen embrittlement is a challenge in such cases and needs to be addressed. Embrittlement leads to the deterioration of the metal cylinders in which the hydrogen gas is stored and is therefore a safety concern. High-strength steels are more susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement as susceptibility to the phenomenon increases with strength. Safe hydrogen storage systems demand improved storage materials and modification of existing ones. Few materials and methods are available to reduce hydrogen diffusion in these steels. However, a detailed microstructural analysis of high-strength steel is necessary to make it a hydrogen-impermeable material. Multilayered coatings can be effective in the prevention of embrittlement. In this article, the analysis of current hydrogen storage methods along with the various coatings and deposition techniques that can reduce hydrogen permeation in high-strength steels is carried out. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is one of the main energy carriers playing a prominent role in the future decarbonization of the economy. However, several aspects regarding the transport and storage of this gas are challenging. The intermediary conversion of hydrogen into high-density energy molecules may be a crucial step until technological conditions are ready to attain a significant reduction in fossil fuel use in transport and the industrial sector. The process of transforming hydrogen into methane by anaerobic digestion is reviewed, showing that this technology is a feasible option for facilitating hydrogen storage and transport. The manuscript focuses on the role of anaerobic digestion as a technology driver capable of fast adaptation to current energy needs. The use of thermophilic systems and reactors capable of increasing the contact between the H2-fuel and liquid phase demonstrated outstanding capabilities, attaining higher conversion rates and increasing methane productivity. Pressure is a relevant factor of the process, allowing for better hydrogen solubility and setting the basis for considering feasible underground hydrogen storage concomitant with biological methanation. This feature may allow the integration of sequestered carbon dioxide as a relevant substrate. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive analysis using the finite element method (FEM) to examine and evaluate the behavior of fuel carrier ship structure. Sandwich panels are effective structures for use in ship structures due to their lightweight yet robust nature. Sandwich panels used in ship structures have various core shapes, such as hexagonal, circular, and square, as needed. The sandwich panel structure can be widely implemented in ship construction, for example, on the deck, hull, and bulkhead of the ship's cabin. Hydrogen is an alternative fuel that can replace fossil fuels. In this modern era, hydrogen is high valuable energy commodity, so accidents involving carrier ships could have significant consequences. Hydrogen is produced from liquefied natural gas (LNG), so if a leak occurs, for instance, in a storage tank or fuel tank, it has the potential to lead to accidents such as fires. Corrosion is a significant concern for the maritime industry, as it can jeopardize the structural integrity of these vessels and pose substantial safety and environmental risks. In this research, FEM was utilized to model and simulate the effects of corrosion on hydrogen carrier ships when exposed to fire, considering various environmental and operational factors. Through a systematic investigation, it is aimed to gain insights into the impact of corrosion on ship structural components during fires, such as hulls and storage tanks. The result of this study will contribute to improving corrosion and fire mitigation strategies, ensuring the safety and longevity of hydrogen and LNG carrier ships, and supporting the sustainable transportation of hydrogen to meet global energy demands. No research has been conducted on the structural behavior resulting from hydrogen fires and corrosion simultaneously. To achieve this, it is assumed to use the corrosion properties of steel in heavily traveled ship routes such as the Panama Canal Zone, Barent Sea, North Sea, and Suez Canal Zone. This study utilized an approach by modeling corrosion using shell thickness in Abaqus Quasi-Static and applying boundary conditions in the form of temperature increase up to 800°C and subsequent cooling back to the initial temperature. At the maximum temperature, the most significant mid-span displacement occurred in the circular core sandwich panel, with a value of 4 mm. The axial force in the structure was inversely proportional to the mid-span displacement. In the case of the circular core sandwich panel, the axial force was 96 kN. The most resilient core type was hexagonal because it experiences the least deformation when compared to circular and square cores.  © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {The main challenges of liquid hydrogen (H2) storage as one of the most promising techniques for large-scale transport and long-term storage include its high specific energy consumption (SEC), low exergy efficiency, high total expenses, and boil-off gas losses. This article reviews different approaches to improving H2 liquefaction methods, including the implementation of absorption cooling cycles (ACCs), ejector cooling units, liquid nitrogen/liquid natural gas (LNG)/liquid air cold energy recovery, cascade liquefaction processes, mixed refrigerant systems, integration with other structures, optimization algorithms, combined with renewable energy sources, and the pinch strategy. This review discusses the economic, safety, and environmental aspects of various improvement techniques for H2 liquefaction systems in more detail. Standards and codes for H2 liquefaction technologies are presented, and the current status and future potentials of H2 liquefaction processes are investigated. The cost-efficient H2 liquefaction systems are those with higher production rates (>100 tonne/day), higher efficiency (>40%), lower SEC (<6 kWh/kgLH2), and lower investment costs (1-2 $/kgLH2). Increasing the stages in the conversion of ortho- to para-H2 lowers the SEC and increases the investment costs. Moreover, using low-temperature waste heat from various industries and renewable energy in the ACC for precooling is significantly more efficient than electricity generation in power generation cycles to be utilized in H2 liquefaction cycles. In addition, the substitution of LNG cold recovery for the precooling cycle is associated with the lower SEC and cost compared to its combination with the precooling cycle.  © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

To enhance the thermal performance of MHs, the incorporation of phase change materials (PCM) is a way to preserve reaction heat. This work proposes a new MH-PCM compact disk configuration (i.e., a truncated conical MH bed surrounded by a PCM ring). An optimization method is developed to find the optimal geometrical parameters of the MH truncated cone, which is then compared to a basic configuration (i.e., a cylindrical MH surrounded by a PCM ring). Moreover, a mathematical model is developed and used to optimize the heat transfer in a stack of MH-PCM disks. The optimum geometric parameters found (bottom radius of 0.2, top radius of 0.75 and tilt angle of 58.24) allow the truncated conical MH bed to reach a faster heat transfer rate and a large surface area of higher heat exchange. Compared to a cylindrical configuration, the optimized truncated cone shape enhances the heat transfer rate and the reaction rate in the MH bed by 37.68%. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the field of hydrogen safety and combustion, the effect of obstacles on hydrogen deflagration is a topic of general interest to scholars. In previous studies, scholars usually used uniform obstacles under various operating conditions and obtained conclusions by changing their number and positions. However, in practice, the shapes of obstacles at an accident site are often not the same and regular. In this paper, a series of obstacles with variations in length were investigated, and the effects of the obstacles on hydrogen deflagration under different working conditions were analyzed. The configuration of the obstacles with gradually increasing lengths amplified the vortices in the flow field so that the propagation direction of the flame front surface was reversed after passing three obstacles. The variations in the lengths of the obstacles had a significant stretching effect on the propagation of the flame and a considerable acceleration effect on the propagation speed of the flame. The main reason for the acceleration was the rapid propagation of the flame achieved by the vortex when rupture occurred. The change in the pressure gradient that occurred at the center of rotation caused rapid movement of the combustion gases, which ultimately led to an increase in the flame propagation speed. A configuration with gradually increasing lengths of the obstacles promoted the overpressure. A configuration with gradually decreasing lengths of the obstacles suppressed the overpressure. The reason for the formation of the local high-pressure area was that unburned gas was accumulated there by pressure waves and the obstacle walls, and then the thermal expansion formed a high pressure. The Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities caused the overpressure to rise further. The results can provide a theoretical basis for hydrogen transportation, storage, and safety. © (2024), (Isfahan University of Technology). All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of renewable energies has the potential to decarbonize the electricity supply. This is more challenging in difficult-to-electrify sectors. The use of hydrogen provides a massive potential for this issue. However, expanding hydrogen production increases electricity demand while providing additional flexibility to the electricity market. This paper mainly aims to analyze the economic effects of this sector coupling between the European electricity and national hydrogen markets. The developed energy market model jointly considers both markets to reach an overall welfare optimum. A novel modeling approach allows the interaction of these markets without the need for several iterative optimization runs. This allows for a detailed analysis of various market participants’ changes in consumer and producer surpluses. The optimization is conducted in 13 connected Central European countries to account for various power plant fleets, generation mixes, and electricity prices. Results show an overall welfare increase of EUR 4 to 28 billion in 2030 and an EUR 5 to 158 billion increase in 2040. However, there is a surplus shift from consumers to producers. The consumer surplus is reduced by up to EUR 44 billion in 2030 and EUR 60 billion while producers benefit to achieve the overall welfare benefits. The reduction of consumer surplus changes if significant price peaks occur. Fuel cell applications can avoid these price peaks, resulting in a surplus shift from thermal power plants to consumers. Hence, consumer surplus can increase by up to EUR 146 billion in the respective 2040 scenarios. Pink hydrogen accounts for a sizable portion of total hydrogen production, up to 58 percent in 2030 and up to 30 percent in 2040. As a result, nuclear power plants that are nearly entirely allocated in France stand to benefit greatly from this sector coupling. Additional efforts could be made to address the link between hydrogen and natural gas prices. Furthermore, the potential for cross-border hydrogen trade and the implementation of national legal and regulatory frameworks could be assessed. © 2023 by the authors.},

The design of modern cylindrical-shaped reactors makes it possible to optimize the number of heat exchange elements, design of fins and cooling tubes, filter arrangement and geometrical distribution of metal hydride bed elements. Thus, the development of a metal hydride reactor design with optimal weight and size characteristics, taking into account the efficiency of heat transfer and metal hydride bed design, is the relevant task. This paper discusses the influence of different configurations of heat exchangers and metal hydride bed for modern solid-state hydrogen storage systems. The main advantages and disadvantages of various configurations are considered in terms of heat transfer as well as weight and size characteristics. A comparative analysis of the heat exchangers, fins and other solutions efficiency has been performed, which makes it possible to summarize and facilitate the choice of the reactor configuration in the future. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Building heating is one of the sectors for which multiple decarbonisation options exist and current geopolitical tensions provide urgency to design adequate regional policies. Heat pumps and hydrogen boilers, alongside alternative district heating systems, are the most promising alternatives. Although a host of city or country-level studies exist, it remains controversial what role hydrogen should play for building heating in the European Union compared with electrification and how blue and green hydrogen differ in terms of costs and environmental impacts. This works assesses the optimal technology mix for staying within planetary boundaries, and the influence of international cooperation and political restrictions. To perform the analysis, a bottom-up optimisation model was developed incorporating life cycle assessment constraints and covering production, storage, transport of energy and carbon dioxide, as well as grid and non-grid connected end-users of heat. It was found that a building heating system within planetary boundaries is feasible through large-scale electrification via heat pumps, although at a higher cost than the current system with abatement costs of around 200 €/ton CO2. Increasing interconnector capacity or onshore wind energy is found to be vital to staying within boundaries. A strong trade-off for hydrogen was identified, with blue hydrogen being cost-competitive but vastly unsustainable (when applied to heating) and green hydrogen being 2–3 times more expensive than electrification while still transgressing several planetary boundaries. The insights from this work indicate that heat pumps and renewable electricity should be prioritised over hydrogen-based heating in most cases and grid-stability and storage aspects explored further, while revealing a need for policy instruments to mitigate increased costs for consumers. © 2022 The Author(s)},

According to hydrogen demand in Poland and to ensure stability as well as security of energy supply and also the realization of energy policy for the EU, it is necessary to use offshore wind energy for direct hydrogen production. In this study, a centralized offshore hydrogen production system in the Baltic Sea area was presented. The goal of our research was to explore the possibility of producing hydrogen using offshore wind energy. After analyzing wind conditions and calculating the capacity of the proposed wind farm, a 600 MW offshore hydrogen platform was designed along with a pipeline to transport hydrogen to onshore storage facilities. Taking into account Poland’s Baltic Sea area wind conditions with capacity factor between 45 and 50% and having obtained results with highest monthly average output of 3508.85 t of hydrogen, it should be assumed that green hydrogen production will reach profitability most quickly with electricity from offshore wind farms. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The interaction of hydrogen in shale gas formations holds significant interest for long-term subsurface hydrogen storage. Accurately and rapidly predicting hydrogen adsorption in these formations is crucial for assessing underground hydrogen storage potential. Many laboratory experiments and molecular simulations have been conducted to determine hydrogen adsorption. However, laboratory experiments and molecular simulations require complex setups and extensive calculations, which can be time-consuming. Consequently, end-users may prefer quick and accurate prediction of hydrogen adsorption to reduce the experimental and computational burden. This study introduces a novel model for predicting hydrogen adsorption using gradient boosting regression and available molecular simulation data from the literature. The data-driven model predicts hydrogen adsorption on kerogen structures based on pressure, temperature, adsorbed methane, hydrogen-to‑carbon ratio, oxygen-to‑carbon ratio, and kerogen density. We compared gradient-boosting regression with other machine learning tools, including artificial neural networks, symbolic regression assisted with genetic programming, decision trees, and random forests in terms of their capability to predict H2 adsorption on shale kerogen. A simple mathematical equation based on symbolic regression via genetic programming has also been provided, with training and testing coefficients of determination of 88.4% and 85.8%, respectively. However, the digital model created using gradient boosting regression outperformed all other machine learning tools, achieving a coefficient of determination of 99.6% for training data and 94.6% for testing data. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted that demonstrates the robustness of the developed model. In the case of kerogen type A, the order of increasing hydrogen adsorption is KIA < KIIA<KIIIA. Conversely, for kerogen type B, the trend is KIIA<KIIC<KIIB<KIID in terms of increasing hydrogen adsorption. This developed digital model offers higher prediction accuracy and finds applications in storing hydrogen in shale gas formations. The proposed model offers a substantial time-saving advantage in predicting hydrogen adsorption compared to laborious and time-consuming laboratory experiments and/or molecular simulations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A numerical model considering phase change and heat transfer was established by the Euler-Euler two-fluid method to investigate the storage characteristics and two-phase flow field of slush hydrogen. Numerous numerical simulations were performed to discuss the effect of particle diameter (dp = 0.02–0.5 mm), content of solid hydrogen (αs = 10%–50%), and heat leakage (q = 50–200W·m−2) on the flow field. It was found that particle deposition could occur during the storage process, and there exist moving vortices with contrary directions under specific conditions. The sedimentation characteristics and vortex size are influenced by many factors including particle size, solid hydrogen content, and heat leakage. An increase in particle size could lead to the strengthening of precipitation and the expansion of the counterclockwise vortex region on the right side of the tank. And the increase in solid hydrogen content could result in more deposition and more collisions and friction between particles. Moreover, the increase in heat leakage could increase the area of the counterclockwise vortex. Numerical results of the deposition and flow field characteristics in the storage tank could clearly show the physical law of the slush hydrogen so that the uniform distribution of slush hydrogen could be promoted for efficient storage and application. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy represents a crucial pathway towards achieving carbon neutrality and is a pivotal facet of future strategic emerging industries. The safe and efficient transportation of hydrogen is a key link in the entire chain development of the hydrogen energy industry’s “production, storage, and transportation”. Mixing hydrogen into natural gas pipelines for transportation is the potential best way to achieve large-scale, long-distance, safe, and efficient hydrogen transportation. Welds are identified as the vulnerable points in natural gas pipelines, and compatibility between hydrogen-doped natural gas and existing pipeline welds is a critical technical challenge that affects the global-scale transportation of hydrogen energy. Therefore, this article systematically discusses the construction and weld characteristics of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines, the research status of hydrogen damage mechanism, and mechanical property strengthening methods of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds, and points out the future development direction of hydrogen damage mechanism research in hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds. The research results show that: ① Currently, there is a need for comprehensive research on the degradation of mechanical properties in welds made from typical pipe materials on a global scale. It is imperative to systematically elucidate the mechanism of mechanical property degradation due to conventional and hydrogen-induced damage in welds of high-pressure hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines worldwide. ② The deterioration of mechanical properties in welds of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines is influenced by various components, including hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. It is necessary to reveal the mechanism of mechanical property deterioration of pipeline welds under the joint participation of multiple damage mechanisms under multi-component gas conditions. ③ Establishing a fundamental database of mechanical properties for typical pipeline steel materials under hydrogen-doped natural gas conditions globally is imperative, to form a method for strengthening the mechanical properties of typical high-pressure hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds. ④ It is essential to promptly develop relevant standards for hydrogen blending transportation, welding technology, as well as weld evaluation, testing, and repair procedures for natural gas pipelines. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy has been considered to be one of the most potential clean energy, but its widespread availability is limited by hydrogen safety. Herein, a hydrogen-oxygen combination catalyst is designed based on a ZrVFe hydrogen storage alloy loaded with Pd, which exhibits excellent hydrogen elimination capability at low temperature, broad hydrogen concentration range and other complex working environments. The results show that the activity of the Pd/ZrVFe catalyst is dependent on the Pd loadings, and the 2 wt% Pd/ZrVFe catalyst can initiate the hydrogen-oxygen elimination reaction rapidly at ∼30 °C under above 2 vol% hydrogen concentration and 2 L min−1 inlet gas flow with a 96% hydrogen elimination efficiency. The Pd/ZrVFe catalyst has excellent hydrogen elimination performance at 2–20 vol% hydrogen concentration, especially at hydrogen concentration above 10%, the hydrogen elimination efficiency can reach more than 99%, and the highest hydrogen elimination rate is as high as 182.6 mL min−1· g−1. In addition, the Pd/ZrVFe catalyst is almost unaffected by irradiation and aerosol poisoning, and this catalyst provided better resistance to iodine vapor poisoning compared to other catalysts.

	abstract = {This study aims to assess the performance of the Hybrid Solar Thermal Storage (HSTS) system, the storage system proposed for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. The heat storage hybridisation concept is based on coupling latent phase change material (PCM) and thermochemical storage system containing paired metal hydride (MH) beds. One base design which uses only thermochemical heat storage mode and two designs of the HSTS system with two distinct PCM heat exchanger designs (i.e., shell-and-tube and cylinder with truncated hollow cones) are proposed and numerically investigated. To predict the dynamic behavior of the three storage systems, a bidimensional mathematical model is established and a numerical code written in Fortran-90 is developed. Key performance indicators used to evaluate the performance of the three storage systems include volumetric storage capacity, specific power, state of hydrogen charge, and energy storage efficiency. Comparing the performance of the three systems reveals that the HSTS system's energy storage efficiency increased by 36% due to the integration of a reaction heat recovery internal system based on Na3Al as PCM. The use of the PCM in truncated hollow cones resulted in a 36.4% reduction of the heat charging and discharging time, an 18.5% increase storage capacity, and a 54.1% increase in specific power. In addition, this study proves that the third design can be imlpemented as a HSTS system in a solar power plant with the following performance indexes: 128 W/kg- Mg2FeH6, 160 MJ/m3 and 88% for specific power, volumetric storage capacity and energy storage efficiency, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Several countries have revised their targets in recent years to reach net-zero CO2 emissions across all sectors by 2050, and the transport sector is responsible for a significant share of these emissions. This study compares possible pathways to decarbonise the transport sector including passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles. To do so, we explore 125 scenarios by varying the share of battery and hydrogen-based fuel cell electric vehicles in each of the three categories above independently. We further model the decarbonisation of the industrial hydrogen demand using electrolysers with hydrogen storage. To explore the potential role of electric and hydrogen transport, as well as their trade-offs, we use GRIMSEL, an open-source sector coupling energy system model of Switzerland which includes the residential, commercial, industrial and transport sectors with four energy carriers, namely electricity, heat, hot water and hydrogen. The total costs are minimised from a social planner perspective. We find that the decarbonisation of the transport sector could lead, on average, to a 12% increase in costs by 2050 and 1.3 MtCO2/year which represents a 90% CO2 emissions reduction for the whole sector, compared to fossil-based transport. Second, the transport energy self-sufficiency (i.e. the share of domestic electricity generation in final transport demand) may reach up to 50% for the scenarios with the largest share of battery electric vehicles, mainly due to a smaller energy demand than with hydrogen vehicles. Third, more than three quarters of the industrial hydrogen production is met by local photovoltaic electricity coupled with battery at minimum costs, i.e. green hydrogen. Finally, the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier to store electricity over a long period is not cost-optimal. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Metal hydride (MH) is an efficient hydrogen storage method with high density and moderate operating conditions. Thermal management is required for hydrogen storage and release to cope with the strong thermal effects generated by the reaction. The MH reactor with spiral fins is proposed to improve the hydrogen storage efficiency by increasing the heat transfer characteristics of the reactor. The hydrogen absorption and desorption performances of the MH reactors with different spiral fin structures have been discussed. The results show that the MH reactor with spiral fins present better reaction performance compared to that of the MH reactor with longitudinal fins. And the larger the fin spiral cycle (SC), the faster the reaction rate. The hydrogenation time and dehydrogenation time could be maximally reduced 29.8% and 29.2% with fin spiral cycle increasing from 1/4 to 1, where the hydrogen storage density kept constant. The hydrogenation time and dehydrogenation time could be reduced 53.1% and 34.7% with fin number (FN) increasing from 4 to 16, while the hydrogen storage density is reduced 24.1%. Keep the volume of fins consistent, the fin number and fin thickness (FT) are optimized, and the results are FN = 8, SC = 1, FT = 1 mm, the corresponding hydrogen storage density is 0.087 g mm−1. The performance of the reactor with the optimal fin parameters under different operation conditions was also analyzed. The recommended operation parameters are concluded as the hydrogen pressure of 1.0 MPa for absorption and 0.1 MPa for desorption, heat transfer wall temperature of 293.15 K for absorption and 353.15 K for desorption. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage is a promising technique that could handle the challenges of intermittent renewable production on the electric grid. Metal Hydride (MH) is a promising hydrogen storage technique owing to its safety, availability, and high volumetric storage density. However, MH requires an efficient heat management system. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-layer cylindrical reactor where layers of MH and phase change material (PCM) are alternatively arranged. A numerical model is developed utilizing COMSOL Multiphysics software and is validated to predict the performance of the proposed reactor at various design parameters. As PCM thermal conductivity changes from 0.2 to 3 W/m.K, absorption time, based on 90 % absorption, reduces from 3555 s to 675 s (∼5.33 times reduction). Compared to a reference case, four layers system reduces absorption time by 78 %. Lithium nitrate trihydrate as PCM material exhibits the best performance, allowing four layers to greatly reduce reactor volume with a slight absorption time delay. The analysis introduces two novel parameters expressing the absorption rate per system mass and volume. From the intensive analysis, the specific capacity rate (SCR) of the proposed reactor is 1.51 gH2/min/kgsys, while the volumetric capacity rate (VCR) of the proposed reactor is 3016 gH2/min/m3sys. SCR and VCR are 3.4 and 3.12 times higher than the corresponding values in literature. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The globe is witnessing a significant energy transformation with an increasing proportion of variable energy sources like wind and solar on the grid. Energy storage solutions are required to enable a seamless integration of these renewable energy sources. This paper presents a novel isothermal compressed air energy storage (CAES) consisting of two floating storage vessels in the deep ocean that operates by balancing the pressure of the upper and lower tanks with the oceanic pressure. The methodology consists of estimating the proposed system's energy storage potential and operational parametrization. Results show that the maximum compression ratio between the two storage vessels is four, which significantly increases the system's efficiency and lowers compression costs. Compressed air seesaw energy storage is a cheap alternative for storing compressed air because it does not require large, pressurized tanks or sand cavers. It is expected to cost between 10 and 50 USD/kWh for electric energy storage and between 800 and 1500 USD/kW for the installed power capacity. Seesaw is an interesting alternative to pumped hydro and hydrogen for long-term energy storage cycles in islands and coastal regions close to the deep sea. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Inevitable evaporation process occurring in liquid hydrogen storage may bring about safety risks associated with over-pressure and hydrogen discharge. Using a cryogenic refrigerator to compensate for the heat leakage is expected to eliminate the risk of hydrogen vent, realizing long-term lossless storage. Presently, active lossless storage technology applied on civil fields has rarely been studied. This paper presents a numerical study on the dynamic evolution process within an active cooling system of a liquid hydrogen tank. The accuracy of the model is validated with an average deviation of 0.47%. During the self-pressurized process, the maximum temperature difference is more than 26 K in the ullage zone. After cooling capacity being introduced, a three-stage depressurization process appears. Minor cooling capacity that is less than heat leakage can still realize pressure management. Further analyses show two operating modes similar to gravity heat pipes and thermal redistributors occurring in the ullage and the liquid zone, respectively.

	abstract = {This paper compares six (6) alternatives for green hydrogen transport at sea. Two (2) alternatives of liquid hydrogen (LH2) by ship, two (2) alternatives of compressed hydrogen (cH2) by ship and two (2) alternatives of hydrogen by pipeline. The ship alternatives study having hydrogen storage media at both end terminals to reduce the ships’ time at port or prescinding of them and reduce the immobilized capital. In the case of the pipeline, new models are proposed by considering pressure costs. One scenario considers that there are compression stations every 500 km and the other one considers that there are none along the way. These alternatives are assessed under nine different scenarios that combine three distances: 100 km, 2500 km, and 5000 km; and three export rates of hydrogen 100 kt/y, 1 Mt/y and 10 Mt/y. The results show, including uncertainty bands, that for the 100 km of distance the best alternative is the pipeline. For 2500 km and 100 kt/y the top alternative is cH2 shipping without storage facilities at the port terminals. For 2500 km and 1 Mt/y and for 5000 km and 100 kt/y the best alternatives are cH2 or LH2 shipping. For the remaining scenarios the best alternative is LH2 shipping. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {In order to generate electricity at night and on cloudy days, concentrated solar power (CSP) plants need a sufficient thermal energy storage (TES) unit. The most effective TES unit that combines thermochemical and latent heat storage techniques. In the present paper, for CSP plants, a new MH/PCM-TES unit design is proposed. This unit consist of paired metal hydride (MH) tanks that are connected. The high-temperature metal hydride (HTMH) tank filled with Mg2Fe alloy is used to store solar heat, while the low-temperature metal hydride (LTMH) tank filled with Na3Al alloy is used to store hydrogen that desorbed by the HTMH tank during heat charging process. The thermochemical heat released by the LTMH tank is stored as latent heat in a PCM truncated heat exchanger for reuse during desorption pocess. A two-dimensional mathematical model is established and a numerical code written in Fortran-90 is developed to study the performance of the proposed hybrid heat storage unit. The volumetric storage capacity, the specific power, and the energy efficiency are used as key performance indicators of the new MH/PCM-TES unit. The effects of the PCM's thermo-physical proprieties and the operating temperatures are investigated and discussed. The obtained numerical results demonstrated that the heat charging/discharging temperature and thermo-physical properties of PCM (melting temperture, density, thermal conductivity, specific heat) had a substantial effect on the used key performance indicators. In addition, it was found that the use of PCM with the LTMH tank enhances the energy recovery efficiency of the hybrid heat storage unit by about 30%. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Each MH tube is packed with 1.35 kg of La0.8Ce0.2Ni5 constituting 26.5 kg active material. Water at a flow rate of 0.9–1.5 m3.h−1 was circulated through the shell side of the reactor to serve as heat transfer fluid (HTF) during absorption and desorption. Outcomes of the parametric investigation indicated that the favourable absorption temperature and pressure were in the range of 10–20 bar and 283–293 K, respectively. The reactor was able to store 369.09 g (1.39 wt.%) hydrogen within 1372 s at 20 bar and 293 K. Promising desorption regime was identified as 323–343 K necessitating only 0.8–1.7 kW average heating rate. The time required for desorption completion (t90%) was at par with published results.

	abstract = {Metal hydrides are a class of materials that can absorb and release large amounts of hydrogen. They have a wide range of potential applications, including their use as a hydrogen storage medium for fuel cells or as a hydrogen release agent for chemical processing. While being a technology that can supersede existing energy storage systems in manifold ways, the use of metal hydrides also faces some challenges that currently hinder their widespread applicability. As the effectiveness of heat transfer across metal hydride systems can have a major impact on their overall efficiency, an affluent description of more efficient heat transfer systems is needed. The literature on the subject has proposed various methods that have been used to improve heat transfer in metal hydride systems over the years, such as optimization of the shape of the reactor vessel, the use of heat exchangers, phase change materials (PCM), nano oxide additives, adding cooling tubes and water jackets, and adding high thermal conductivity additives. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the latest, state-of-the-art techniques in metal hydride reactor design and heat transfer enhancement methodologies and identifies key areas for future researchers to target. A comprehensive analysis of thermal management techniques is documented, including performance comparisons among various approaches and guidance on selecting appropriate thermal management techniques. For the comparisons, the hydrogen adsorption time relative to the reactor size and to the amount of hydrogen absorbed is studied. This review wishes to examine the various methods that have been used to improve heat transfer in metal hydride systems and thus aims to provide researchers and engineers working in the field of hydrogen storage with valuable insights and a roadmap to guide them to further explore the development of effective thermal management techniques for metal hydrides. © 2023 by the authors.},

Notable investment is directed toward hydrogen research and material innovation for transmission, storage, fuel cells, and sensors. Ensuring safe and dependable hydrogen facilities is paramount, given the challenges in accident control. Addressing material compatibility issues within hydrogen systems remains a critical focus. Challenges, roadmaps, and scenarios steer long-term planning and technology outlooks. Strategic visions align actions and policies, encompassing societal and ecological dimensions. The confluence of hydrogen’s promise with material progress holds the prospect of reshaping our energy landscape sustainably. Forming collective future perspectives to foresee this emerging technology’s potential benefits is valuable. Our review article comprehensively explores the forthcoming challenges in hydrogen technology. We extensively examine the challenges and opportunities associated with hydrogen production, incorporating CO2 capture technology. Furthermore, the interaction of materials and composites with hydrogen, particularly in the context of hydrogen transmission, pipeline, and infrastructure, are discussed to understand the interplay between materials and hydrogen dynamics. Additionally, the exploration extends to the embrittlement phenomena during storage and transmission, coupled with a comprehensive examination of the advancements and hurdles intrinsic to hydrogen fuel cells.

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this research is to carry out a literature review on the use of life-cycle cost (LCC) approaches for hydrogen technologies, by analysing its evolution over a decade (2012–2021). Methods: The SCOPUS database has been used to select relevant literature on the subject. After adoption of inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 67 papers were selected for our review. Then, we analysed these studies in terms of hydrogen technologies (fuel cells, electrolysers, hydrogen storage approach, etc.) covered by the LCC approaches. In addition, we also performed an analysis of the LCC features — type of LCC (conventional, environmental, social), integration with LCA/S-LCA, guidelines followed, system boundaries (cradle-to-farm gate, cradle-to-consumer, cradle-to-grave, cradle-to-cradle), functional units, financial tools (NPV, BEP, etc.), type of costs included, and life span — to provide a comprehensive view of LCC studies applied to hydrogen technologies. We also discussed and interpreted the most significant findings. Results and discussion: Our main results can be summarised as follows: (i) the number of LCC studies for application to hydrogen technologies has increased in the decade 2012–2021; (ii) China is the leading country for number of publications on the subject (15 papers), even if the most prolific author and institution are Iranians; (iii) a large number of studies performed LCC analysis including fuel cells and/or electrolysers based on proton exchange membranes; (iv) the most widely used LCC approach is a cradle-to-consumer (37 papers); (vi) almost all the studies on LCC of hydrogen technologies included initial, operation and maintenance costs; while other costs — replacement, external, end-of-life — are included in a limited number of papers; (vii) the net present value (NPV) is the most used financial tool. Conclusions: LCC analysis for application to hydrogen technologies has gained interest in recent years. However, the number of studies that explicitly follow LCC or LCA guidelines is very limited (only 7). The life-cycle cost analyses performed are quite incomplete in terms of costs included in the life-cycle stages. Besides, there is a lack of information and uniformity in the use of functional units and financial tools. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen is emerging as one of the most promising alternatives to replace fossil fuels. While hydrogen gas has a good energy density by weight, its poor energy density by volume requires it to be stored under high pressure for commercial use. The hydrogen infrastructure developed to handle this high pressure hydrogen contains multiple components made of polymers such as O-rings, pipes, hoses, and inner liners of storage tanks. Although polymers do not react chemically with hydrogen gas, they undergo a mechanical failure when high pressure hydrogen gas is suddenly depressurized. This phenomenon known as ‘rapid decompression failure’ (RDF) occurs due to the diffusion of hydrogen through polymer and getting trapped inside preexisting cavities or voids. In this paper, a continuum mechanics-based coupled diffusion–deformation-damage model was developed to predict the hydrogen distribution, stress distribution, and damage propagation inside the polymer while it undergoes rapid decompression failure. The polymer was modeled as a hyperelastic material because it represents the nonlinear material response observed in uniaxial tensile tests perfectly. The effect of hydrogen diffusivity, preexisting cavity size, cavity location, applied hydrogen pressure, and depressurization rate on damage initiation was studied. It was found that the coefficient of diffusion plays an important role in damage initiation and damage was mostly concentrated in the inside areas rather than near the surface. Experiments were conducted with ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) which agreed well with the predicted trends using the given model. The effect of adding carbon black and silica filler particles and plasticizer to the pure EPDM polymer was also studied. It was found that damage during RDF decreases with the addition of fillers, but increases with the addition of the plasticizer. Finally, the damage evolution in the presence of two cavities was also studied, and was found that the interaction of stress fields around the cavities alters the damage occurring during RDF. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Liquid accumulation in gas transmission pipelines can be a significant obstacle in UWCGES systems. In this study, an experimental investigation is conducted to improve the understanding of the kinematics of liquid accumulation. A pressure signal is used for identifying the state of fluid flow in the pipe. Seven kinds of time-domain features are selected through monotonicity. An adaptive evaluation method for slug flow is proposed. The fused features are submitted as a Gaussian distribution through Box-Cox transformation (BCT), and ± 3 sigma criterion is set as the threshold range to adaptively identify slug flow. Beyond this, a maximum impact force model is established and the largest impact force produced during slugging is predicted. It is found that the inlet velocity, followed by the inclination angle of the pipe and the volume of liquid accumulation, most notably influences the impact force. The model and results have the potential to be further developed for remote monitoring of liquid accumulation in pipelines, which is important for UWCGES systems. © 2023},

	abstract = {Industries across the world are making the transition to net-zero carbon emissions, as government policies and strategies are proposed to mitigate the impact of climate change on the planet. As a result, the use of hydrogen as an energy source is becoming an increasingly popular field of research, particularly in the aviation sector, where an alternative, green, renewable fuel to the traditional hydrocarbon fuels such as kerosene is essential. Hydrogen can be stored in multiple ways, including compressed gaseous hydrogen, cryo-compressed hydrogen and cryogenic liquid hydrogen. The infrastructure and storage of hydrogen will play a pivotal role in the realisation of large-scale conversion from traditional fuels, with safety being a key consideration. This paper provides a review on previous work undertaken to study the characterisation of both unignited and ignited hydrogen jets, which are fundamental phenomena for the utilisation of hydrogen. This includes work that focuses on the near-field flow structure, dispersion in the far-field, ignition and flame characteristics with multi-physics. The safety considerations are also included. The theoretical models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) multiphase and reactive flow approaches are discussed. Then, an overview of previous experimental work is provided, before focusing the review on the existing computational results, with comparison to experiments. Upon completion of this review, it is highlighted that the complex near-field physics and flow phenomena are areas lacking in research. The near-field flow properties and characteristics are of significant importance with respect to the ignition and combustion of hydrogen. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The carbon nanotubes (CNT) market is anticipated to witness a twofold expansion throughout the 2020s, in parallel with the ascendance of hydrogen (H2) as a pivotal element in the energy mix. This study assesses the economic feasibility of manufacturing CNTs and hydrogen utilizing Floating Catalyst Chemical Vapor Deposition (FC-CVD) methodologies within oil and gas (O&G) infrastructures. This approach is proposed as a strategic initiative to monetize methane, which is frequently subjected to flaring and possesses a Global Warming Potential (GWP) 27–30 times higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 100-year period (Understanding Global Warming Potentials 2023). A comprehensive techno-economic model was constructed utilizing a process-driven cost framework that encompasses precursor materials, energy expenditures, and infrastructural investment considerations. These precursors include methane as a carbon source, specialized catalysts facilitating the dissociation of carbon and hydrogen during the reaction, and carriers that enhance the quality of the resultant CNT materials. From an infrastructural perspective, costs incorporate the utilization of distinct reactors tailored for methane pyrolysis. Additionally, the model integrates the costs of pressure swing adsorption systems (PSA) for hydrogen segregation and systems for hot gas processing. For the economic evaluation, a production timeframe of 10 years is postulated. Metrics such as the unit production breakeven price are assessed assuming a discount rate of 10%. An industrial-scale FC-CVD process facility, designed to produce 1,000 metric tons of CNT materials yearly, is projected to manufacture at costs as low as $14/kg. The economic analysis suggests that O&G companies could secure profits given the present market price for CNTs ranging from $100 to $1000, effectively reducing the production costs of hydrogen (another co-product) to a negligible level. This would, in effect, create a "free" revenue stream from hydrogen production while supplying a crucial material integral to advanced technologies, such as highly efficient batteries. Such a low-carbon approach could potentially be an alternative to the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) model, which typically incurs high energy and financial costs.

	abstract = {Accurate evaluation of thermo-fluid dynamic characteristics in tanks is critically important for designing liquid hydrogen tanks for small-scale hydrogen liquefiers to minimize heat leakage into the liquid and ullage. Due to the high costs, most future liquid hydrogen storage tank designs will have to rely on predictive computational models for minimizing pressurization and heat leakage. Therefore, in this study, to improve the storage efficiency of a small-scale hydrogen liquefier, a three-dimensional CFD model that can predict the boil-off rate and the thermo-fluid characteristics due to heat penetration has been developed. The prediction performance and accuracy of the CFD model was validated based on comparisons between its results and previous experimental data, and a good agreement was obtained. To evaluate the insulation performance of polyurethane foam with three different insulation thicknesses, the pressure changes and thermo-fluid characteristics in a partially liquid hydrogen tank, subject to fixed ambient temperature and wind velocity, were investigated numerically. It was confirmed that the numerical simulation results well describe not only the temporal variations in the thermal gradient due to coupling between the buoyance and convection, but also the buoyancy-driven turbulent flow characteristics inside liquid hydrogen storage tanks with different insulation thicknesses. In the future, the numerical model developed in this study will be used for optimizing the insulation systems of storage tanks for small-scale hydrogen liquefiers, which is a cost-effective and highly efficient approach. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The graphene-based materials are promising for applications in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices due to the intriguing properties, i.e., highly tunable surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, and excellent mechanical behavior. This review summarizes recent development on graphene-based materials for supercapacitor electrodes, based on their macrostructural complexity, i.e., zero-dimensional (0D) (e.g., free-standing graphene dots and particles), one-dimensional (1D) (e.g., fiber-type and yarn-type structures), two-dimensional (2D) (e.g., graphenes and graphene-based nanocomposite films), and three-dimensional (3D) (e.g., graphene foam and hydrogel-based nanocomposites). There are extensive and on-going researches on the rationalization of their structures at varying scales and dimensions, development of effective and low-cost synthesis techniques, design and architecturing of graphene-based materials, as well as clarification of their electrochemical performance. There are several methods for producing graphene, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Graphene-based materials have great potential to be employed in supercapacitors due to their unique two-dimensional structure and inherent physical properties like excellent electrical conductivity and large area. This text summarizes recent developments within the sector of supercapacitors, including double-layer capacitors and quasi-capacitors. The pros and cons of using them in supercapacitors are discussed. Compared to traditional electrodes, graphene-based materials show some new properties and mechanisms within the method of energy storage and release. During this paper, we briefly describe carbon structures, particularly graphene, and also the history of graphene discovery, and briefly describe the synthesis methods, properties, characterization methods, and applications of graphene. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Utilizing solar energy is an efficient method to provide hybrid renewable energy system with sufficient thermal/electrical energy. Meanwhile, the rapid development of electrical vehicles leads to an excess of retired electric vehicles. As a combination of the abovementioned two conceptions, this study proposed and examined a hybrid solar-hydrogen-retired electrical vehicle battery energy system to meet thermal and electrical loads for small-scale usage. The novelty of this research is delivered as follows: first of all, the proposed hybrid energy system supplies both thermal and electrical energy to small-scale end users; secondly, the retired electrical vehicle batteries are recycling to relieve the pressure of battery demand; thirdly, an energy management strategy to regulate the complicated hybrid energy system is designed. The results show that with assistance of fuel cell as an energy storage unit, solar energy can basically satisfy the annual thermal/electrical load with maximum monthly energy supplement of 1220.43 MJ and 1572.75 kWh, respectively. However, the solar radiation serving as single energy source is not very reliable for large-scale utilization. Although the state of charge does not fluctuate greatly, the small range charge/discharge between 59% and 63% can still guarantee the normal operation of the proposed hybrid energy system. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Metal hydrides (MH) have recently attracted significant interest for hydrogen storage as they provide large storage capacity and a high degree of safety. The main disadvantage, however, is that storage speed is compromised by their low rate of hydrogen absorption. One possible way to accelerate the absorption reaction, and thus improve storage performance regarding incoming hydrogen transfer speed, is to increase the heat transfer rate inside the storage system. Among internal heat exchangers, using helical coil and semi-cylindrical coil heat exchangers significantly improves the heat transfer performance inside the storage system because of the secondary circulation. However, the central area of the storage system still has a lower heat transfer rate as this area is far away from the heat transfer fluid. For this purpose, the development of a heat exchanger structure is considered for the new achievement of this study. A semi-cylindrical coil heat exchanger incorporating a central return tube (SCHE-CR) is first developed from a semi-cylindrical coil heat exchanger (SCHE) to improve heat exchange rate at the MH central area. The tube size's effect on absorption is analysed. Further, a combination of internal and external heat exchangers is considered for further improvement of MH storage performance. The operating parameters of the heat transfer fluid for various heat exchanger configurations are investigated to determine optimal values. Results from numerical simulations indicate that absorption duration reduces by 30 % in the SCHE-CR case compared to the SCHE. Increasing the tube diameter of SCHE-CR results in a 40 % faster absorption reaction. Using SCHE-CR with a cooling jacket reduces the absorption duration by 51 % compared to the SCHE-CR. Among other operating conditions, the operating temperature of the cooling fluid is found to significantly affect the hydrogen absorption reaction with up to a 36 % enhancement of the absorption rate. However, the heat transfer coefficient between cooling fluid and MH, is not found to have a significant effect, as the improvement of the absorption rate is only 8 %. The new MH reactor configuration would be beneficial to improve heat exchange in MH storage applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Facing the problems concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international ocean shipping has meant that the latest regulations of the International Maritime Organization, issued on 1st January 2023, have come into force, with the aim of reducing GHG emissions from maritime activities. Hydrogen has been suggested as an alternative fuel to achieve decarbonization ambitions in the near future. Although hydrogen has been investigated and developed over the years, its application in ocean freight is still at an embryonic stage, with a very limited number of studies exploring its feasibility. Therefore, this work comprehensively reviewed the pertinent knowledge in the field, associated with the production, storage, and energy-derivation of hydrogen on ships and aims to identify the potential issues and provide possible solutions for fueling the shipping industry with hydrogen energy. It was found that the under-par development of hydrogen-based energy for the shipping industry can be explained by the following reasons: (i) the inability of space-limited ships to use the currently available hydrogen technologies; (ii) difficulties in hydrogen storage; (iii) under-developed infrastructure at hydrogen-bunkering ports; (iv) high retrofitting, maintenance, and operating costs; (v) incomplete guidelines, international rules and regulations for the implementation of hydrogen in fueling global shipping; and (vi) cheaper conventional fuels leading to the reluctancy of industry players to become involved in such a green transition. Finally, several suggestions relating to technological aspects and policy implications were given aiming at advocating the green transition of hydrogen-powered maritime industries for cleaner and more sustainable global trading. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Metal hydride hydrogen storage systems are gaining popularity due to their advantages and suitability for various applications in variety of fields. In this study, a metal hydride reactor using LaNi5 as metal hydride and using water as heat transfer fluid flowing through embedded helical tube was fabricated and experimentally studied. The aim of this study is to experimentally investigate the effect of internal heat transfer arrangement on the absorption and desorption of hydrogen in a metal hydride system. The effect of mass flow rate and temperature of heat transfer fluid, effect of hydrogen supply pressure on the rate of hydrogen absorption and desorption was investigated. It was found that the increase in the hydrogen supply pressure, increase in mass flow rate and decrease in the temperature of heat transfer fluid, results in faster hydrogen absorption rate. Similarly, the increase in mass flow rate and the temperature of heat transfer fluid results in faster hydrogen desorption rate. It was also found out that maximum hydrogen absorbed inside metal hydride reactor was around 34.5 g which corresponds to a gravimetric capacity of 1.34 wt%. Further based on the experimental data various machine learning models were developed and tested and then these models were used for performance prediction. It was found that tree-based regression machine learning models are better compared to other models. Such models can thus be used for prediction of rate of hydrogen absorbed or desorbed and metal hydride bed temperature for different parametric values without doing detailed experimental and numerical trial. Finally, the brute force approach is used to optimize the system for three different applications. The optimization techniques help to fix the value of parameters for particular application and hence save multiple experimental run of absorption and desorption. This is a novel work in the field of using machine learning for modelling and optimizing the metal hydride-based reactor. Use of such tools can save lot of computational time, efforts and experimental resources. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As a plausible solution for the issue of heat management during hydrogen adsorption on the activated carbon bed, in the present paper, the effects of different metal oxides nanoparticles (MgO, TiO2, CuO, or ZnO), scattered into a phase change material (PCM), have been investigated over the adsorption and dormancy phases in a large-scale bottle. This study has been conducted using Fluent software, in which a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (based on finite volume simulations) was implemented. This model has been validated via the experimental and theoretical results available in literature. Throughout the duration of the charging process, it has been found that the presence of nanoparticles in PCM body does not affect the thermal performance of the solid bed of activated carbon,. However, the melt fraction of PCM is steeply increased to 20 % in the range ~ 0–1300 s, whereas over 1300 s, the melting process of paraffin is amortized until the end of the dormancy phase (attaining ~ 30–35 % of liquid PCM). This trend is observed either in the presence or in the absence of metal oxides, where 16 % of enhancement in the liquid fraction of PCM is retrieved in the presence of nanoparticles (5 %) at the end of the dormancy phase (10,000 s). As a result, The nano-PCM system could be a proposed pathway for recovering the heat generated from the H2 adsorption and then replacing the fluid cooling system (cost). However, it was recommended that future research works should be focused on the improvement of the solid bed thermal conductivity in addition to the enhancement of the reactor geometry via new innovative solution pathways. © 2023},

	abstract = {In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in hybrid PV-T collectors and the wider systems within which they can be implemented, and assess the worldwide energy and carbon mitigation potential of these systems. We cover both experimental and computational studies, identify opportunities for performance enhancement, pathways for collector innovation, and implications of their wider deployment at the solar-generation system level. First, we classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air–water, heat-pipe, building integrated and concentrated PV-T collectors. This is followed by a presentation of performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we address wider PV-T systems and their applications, comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S–CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S–CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying and solar for hydrogen production systems. This includes a specific review of potential performance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar-generation system level in thermal energy storage, control and demand-side management. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed to analyse their carbon mitigation potential and how this technology might fit within pathways for global decarbonization. It is estimated that the REmap baseline emission curve can be reduced by more than 16% in 2030 if the uptake of solar PV-T technologies can be promoted. Finally, the review turns to a critical examination of key challenges for the adoption of PV-T technology and recommendations. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The environmental impact of CO2 emissions is widely acknowledged, making the development of alternative propulsion systems a priority. Hydrogen is a potential candidate to replace fossil fuels for transport applications, with three technologies considered for the onboard storage of hydrogen: storage in the form of a compressed gas, storage as a cryogenic liquid, and storage as a solid. These technologies are now competing to meet the requirements of vehicle manufacturers; each has its own unique challenges that must be understood to direct future research and development efforts. This paper reviews technological developments for Hydrogen Storage Vessel (HSV) designs, including their technical performance, manufacturing costs, safety, and environmental impact. More specifically, an up-to-date review of fiber-reinforced polymer composite HSVs was explored, including the end-of-life recycling options. A review of current numerical models for HSVs was conducted, including the use of artificial intelligence techniques to assess the performance of composite HSVs, leading to more sophisticated designs for achieving a more sustainable future. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage using metal hydrides is one of the research hotspots in the field of energy storage. However, metal hydride powders are known to have low thermal conductivity, which causes significant temperature fluctuation and hinders further reaction, hence efficient thermal management is a must for hydrogen storage using metal hydrides. In this paper, based on the principle of entransy dissipation, the optimal profile of fin in a cylindrical reactor under steady-state conditions is deduced. The expression for the temperature distribution of the bed is also obtained, which could clearly account for the influences of multiple involving factors, such as fin thickness, fin spacing, and radius of reactor. Through simulation, the characteristic time of hydrogen absorption for reactor inserting the optimized fin, is shortened by 19.1 % compared with the conventional uniform thickness fin. The influence of the geometric parameters of storage reactor was further discussed. When the ratio of the inner and outer radius of the reactor is confined (rr/rt≤2), linear thinning fin can be seen as a reasonable simplification of the optimized fin with comparable heat transfer enhancement effect. This study proves that the thermal management of metal hydride reactors, particularly those inserting high thermal conductivity materials like graphite, can be optimized quantitatively by entransy theory. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, a numerical model of a T-THX working from room temperature to liquid-hydrogen temperature was developed. Based on the requirement that the heat-exchanger efficiency should be at least 97%, a T-THX was designed and tested. The performance of the T-THX with a temperature span of 280 K was obtained at pressure of 0.539–0.982 MPa and mass flow rate of 4.57–25.81 mg/s. The heat-exchanger efficiency varied from 95.83% to 97.50%, by which the feasibility of the numerical model was preliminarily verified. To improve the calculation accuracy, the T-THX model was modified. Compared with further experimental results, using the modified T-THX model, the relative deviation of the outlet temperature was within 0.3% and the deviation of the heat-exchanger efficiency was less than 0.05%. © 2023},

The thermal management is very important to improve the comprehensive performance of hydrogen storage unit. In present paper, thermochemical material (TCM) is used to storage and release the reaction heat, and a new sandwich configuration reaction bed of MH-TCM system was proposed and its superior hydrogen and thermal storage performance were numerically validated. Firstly, the optimum TCM distribution with a volume ratio (TCM in inner layer to total) of 0.4 was derived for the sandwich bed. Then, comparisons between the sandwich reaction bed and the traditional reaction bed were performed. The results show that the sandwich MH-TCM system has faster heat transfer and reaction rate due to its larger heat transfer area and smaller thermal resistance, which results in the hydrogen storage time is shortened by 61.1%. The heat transfer in the reaction beds have significant effects on performance of MH-TCM systems. Increasing the thermal conductivity of the reaction beds can further reduce the hydrogen storage time. Moreover, improving the hydrogen inflation pressure can result in higher equilibrium temperature, which is beneficial for the enhancing heat transfer and hydrogen absorption rates. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Our research focuses on the decrease in transferable energy content under identical operating conditions as hydrogen is blended in the gas transmission network. Based on the extensive literature review the outstanding challenges and key questions of using hydrogen in the natural gas system are introduced. In our research the transmissible energy factor - TEF - is defined that quantifies the relative energy capacity of the pipeline caused by hydrogen blending. A new equation is proposed in this paper to find the value of TEF at specific pressure and temperature conditions for different hydrogen concentrations. This practical equation helps the natural gas system operators in the decision-making process when hydrogen emerges in the gas transmission system. In this paper the change of the compression power requirement, which increases significantly with hydrogen blending, is investigated in detail. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations is used to simulate the industrial-scale hydrogen storage in activated carbon (AC: AX-21) bottle surrounded by a layer of metal foam (MF)-phase change material (PCM: RT 22 HC) latent thermal unit. The aim is to boost the recuperation (storage) of the heat liberated from the H₂‘s exothermic (adsorption). Following the model's validation, several numerical simulations were performed to evaluate the impact of various physical features of the MF (copper), at variable porosity (ε = 0.80–1.0), on heat transfer in the hole reactor. Independently of the MF porosity, the AC-bed temperature suddenly increased (from 295 K), reaching a maximum (at about 500 s) and decreased afterward. The temperature's intensity was dependent on the probe's position in the AC-bed (i.e. several positions were studied). The H2 concentration in the AC-bed may reach 25 mmol/g. The PCM-based unit received the discharged heat from the AC-bed slowly, but with PCM incorporation in MF, the heat was quickly recovered (stored). Thanks to the MF-induced PCM's increased thermal conductivity, the heat flux, the heat transfer coefficient, and the melting rate of the PCM were all accelerated (during the charging phase) several times by decreasing the MF porosity (increasing MF mass) from 1 (pure PCM) to 0.8. The temperature and the melting contours throughout the absorption process (up 10,000 s) supported all these findings. It is obvious from the results of the current study that improving the reactor geometry and the solid bed's thermal conductivity (thermal performance) is necessary for an effective hydrogen storage system. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen bonding is the prerequisite for polyamide fibers to have better stress–strain behavior. It affects the crystal structure of polyamide fibers, such as orientation and periodic arrangement. To illustrate the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding on fiber orientation structure and macroscopic mechanical properties, this work uses conventional polyamide resin doped with high molecular weight components to construct polymer compounds with discrete distribution characteristics. By analyzing the changes in intermolecular hydrogen bonds, melt rheological properties, non-isothermal crystallization behaviors, the impact of hydrogen bonds on the crystal structure and orientation structure and thus on the fiber strength was clarified. The doping of high molecular weight components can make the compound form more hydrogen bonds and inhibit the relaxation of molecular chains through entanglement, thereby promoting melt non-isothermal crystallization process and increasing complex viscosity η* and storage mode G'. 1D and 2D wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering show that doping components reduce crystal size of α1(200) and α2(002, 202) planes from 4.19 to 3.47 nm and 5.88 to 4.96 nm, resulting in a denser long-period structure. Through the strategy of this work, polyamide 6 fibers' tensile strength is effectively improved by18%, and the mechanical properties are significantly improved. Highlights: High-strength polyamide compound fibers were prepared. Discretely distributed compounds are achieved. Discretely distributed molecular weight enabled hydrogen bonding regulation.

	abstract = {In order to move toward net zero energy buildings, use of new and renewable energy resources parallel with development of high performance energy storage systems is necessary to maximize energy absorption and reduce energy losses with subsequent improvement in the energy performance of systems. In this research, two separate energy storage systems for supplying electricity and hot water for 500 residential buildings in Beijing have been designed and compared based on their performance. 1500 solar panels provide the required power for buildings. The first system is compressed air energy storage (CAES), while the second system is hydrogen energy storage (HES). Simulation has been done in TRNSYS and EES software. Energy and exergy analyses have been done for both systems. In case of the loss of hot water produced by the systems, the annual average energy efficiency of CAES and HES is about 44 % and 42 %, respectively. The energy efficiency of the first system decreases in the hot months of the year and reaches about 42 %, but the efficiency of the HES system is constant throughout the year. If the hot water produced by the systems is used for consumption in residential buildings, the energy efficiency of CAES and HES reaches 93 % and 64 %, respectively. The most exergy destruction in the CAES is related to combustion chambers (41 % of the total exergy destruction) and in the HES, it is related to electrolyzers (71 % of the total exergy destruction). The exergy efficiency of the first system is about 56 %, while for the second system this value is about 34 %. © 2023 International Energy Initiative},

	abstract = {Considering the renewable electricity production using sustainable technologies, such as solar photovoltaics or wind turbines, it is essential to have systems that allow for storing the energy produced during the periods of lower consumption as well as the energy transportation through the distribution network. Despite hydrogen being considered a good candidate, it presents several problems related to its extremely low density, which requires the use of very high pressures to store it. In addition, its energy density in volumetric terms is still clearly lower than that of most liquid fuels. These facts have led to the consideration of ammonia as an alternative compound for energy storage or as a carrier. In this sense, this review deals with the evaluation of using green ammonia for different energetic purposes, such as an energy carrier vector, an electricity generator and E-fuel. In addition, this study has addressed the latest studies that propose the use of nitrogen-derived compounds, i.e., urea, hydrazine, ammonium nitrate, etc., as alternative fuels. In this study, the possibility of using other nitrogen-derived compounds, i.e., an update of the ecosystem surrounding green ammonia, has been assessed, from production to consumption, including storage, transportation, etc. Additionally, the future challenges in achieving a technical and economically viable energy transition have been determined. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, the conventional ways of preparing such materials are mainly focused on doping, which may suffer from phase separation, poor compatibility, and lack of effective methods to promote intersystem crossing and suppress the nonradiative deactivation rates. Herein, we present an intrinsically polymeric RTP system producing long-lived phosphorescence, high quantum yields and multiple colors by stepwise structural confinement to tame triplet excitons. In this strategy, the performance of the materials is improved in two aspects simultaneously: the phosphorescence lifetime of one polymer (9VA-B) increased more than 4 orders of magnitude, and the maximum phosphorescence quantum yield reached 16.04% in halogen-free polymers. Moreover, crack detection is realized by penetrating steam through the materials exposed to humid surroundings as a special quenching effect, and the information storage is carried out by employing the Morse code and the variations in lifetimes. This study provides a different strategy for constructing intrinsically polymeric RTP materials toward targeted applications. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The utilization of hybrid electric propulsion concept in aviation offers a viable solution to address the limitations posed by the relatively low energy density of batteries in fully electric aviation. These hybrid systems enable the aircraft to achieve a significant range while simultaneously minimizing carbon emissions. While the individual components of a Hybrid Electric Propulsion (HEP) system, such as electric motors and batteries, are designed with high efficiency, their integration presents a significant challenge in the realm of thermal management. Designing an efficient system for managing the substantial waste heat generated by heat sources and effectively transferring it to heat sinks during various flight phases is a complex task. This challenge becomes even more critical as the design must adhere to system weight limits and prioritize aviation safety considerations. In this review article, we performed a systematic review of the challenges related to the key elements in a thermal management system. These elements encompass every component or subsystem that contributes to the thermal management of a generic hybrid-electric propulsion system. This includes electric motors and generators, batteries, heat exchangers, power transmission systems, power distribution systems, storages, fuel cells, cooling fluids and pipes, control system, pumps and fans. Following the identification of the challenges, the paper provides a comprehensive summary of the existing solutions that have been offered and pursued by the community to address the challenges. Furthermore, the paper also discusses emerging technologies related to each element, highlighting their potential in overcoming these challenges. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {High-quality borehole is crucial to hydrogen underground storage (HUS) and oil & gas development, while compound drilling plays an important role in improving borehole quality. The modal model of compound drillstring in slim borehole is established by using finite element method to analyze the modal of longitudinal vibration, lateral vibration and torsional vibration. The results shows that as the number of order increases, the intrinsic frequency of the three vibrations increases. The amplitude of axial vibration is the largest, and the amplitude of lateral vibration is smallest. The natural frequency of drillstring in slim borehole decreases as drillstring length increasing. The longer drillstring is, the smaller the interval frequency between the intrinsic frequencies of orders will be, and it is easier to cause resonance. The axial vibration will cause minimal damage to the HUS quality. Lateral vibration has the greatest damage to wellbore quality, and is the most unfavorable for the establishment of HUS channels. The damage of torsional vibration to the HUS is less than the lateral vibration and larger than axial vibration. The higher the vibration frequency and amplitude, the harder it is to improve the HUS quality. In order to improve the quality of HUS, the weight on bit (WOB) and rotary per minutes (RPM) should be adjusted at the same time for lateral shock, and the WOB should be mainly reduced for controlling the axial and torsional vibration.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is regarded as one of the most important energy sources for the future. Safe, large-scale storage of hydrogen contributes to the commercial development of the hydrogen industry. Use of bedded salt caverns for natural gas storage in China provides a new option for underground hydrogen storage (UHS). In this study, the physical properties of multicomponent gases in UHS and salt rock are reviewed and discussed, along with the flow of hydrogen in the surrounding salt rock. Mathematical models of the two-phase multicomponent flow of the gas–brine system in the UHS were established. A numerical model of a simplified elliptical salt cavern was built to simulate the migration of the gas–brine system in the UHS. The hydrogen tightness of the UHS was evaluated through simulation with different storage strategies, salt rock and interlayer permeabilities, and gas components. The results indicate that: (1) Cyclic injection and withdrawal facilitate hydrogen leakage, which is accelerated by increasing the frequency. (2) The huff-n-puff of hydrogen gas in the injection and withdrawal cycles forces the gas into pore space and enhances the relative permeability of the gas phase. The migration of hydrogen and brine weakens the hydrogen tightness. Brine saturation is an important index for evaluating the hydrogen tightness of UHS. (3) The leakage rate of UHS increases with an increase in the permeability of the salt rock and interlayer and the total thickness of the interlayers. The average permeability Kwa weighted by the thickness of layers for the bedded salt formation is proposed to integrate three variables to facilitate field application of the simulation results. The critical Kwa is less than 3.02 × 10−17 m2 if the recommended annual hydrogen leakage rate is less than 1%. (4) The difference between hydrogen and other gas species is another important factor in the leakage rate and should be considered. This study provides theoretical guidance for evaluating the feasibility of UHS in salt caverns and site selection in China. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Due to their large volumetric storage capacity for hydrogen at safe, moderate temperatures and pressures, metal hydrides have received much attention by researchers. Since one of the major controlling factors of the storage process is heat transfer from/to the metal hydride bed, several methods to improving heat transfer have been published. In the present work, electromagnetic induction is investigated numerically as a new heating method to enhance the performance of metal-hydride hydrogen tanks. A two-dimensional mathematical model that describes the dynamic behavior of a LaNi5 hydrogen tank encircled by a copper coil crossed by an alternating current was developped and successfully validated with experimental data. Numerous numerical simulations are performed using this model, and the results reveal that electromagnetic induction can shorten the hydrogen tank's discharging time by 87 % when compared to the heat transfer fluid approach. Furthermore, by raising the desorption temperature from 303 K to 353 K, the discharging time may be reduced by 73 %. The rapidity of the discharging process is unaffected significantly by raising the desorption temperature above 353 K, though. For desorption pressures lower than 0.1 bar, the same effect was observed. Studying the impact of the coil's number of turns per unit length revealed that by increasing this parameter from 640 to 3200, the discharging time is considerably reduced. Nevertheless, increasing this number above 3200 has a negligible impact on the metal-hydride hydrogen tank's dynamic behavior. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Numerical simulation is a powerful way to optimize the thermal management of the system, as long as a quantitative model can be obtained for accurate predictions of de-/hydrogenation performance. Here, we focus on a combined experimental and numerical study of the specific Ti0.92Zr0.10Cr1.0Mn0.6Fe0.4 hydride beds. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the hydrogen absorption and desorption required by the simulation model are first determined, accompanied by an excellent coincidence between measured and fitted results. Meanwhile, two cylindrical test tanks of different sizes were designed to illustrate the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation properties of the metal hydride bed in different scenarios, with 20 g of powder in the small reactor and 700 g in the large one. Further results reveal that the temperature evolution curves obtained from experiments can be well matched with simulation, proving the dependability of the self-designed numerical model and favoring the subsequent performance optimization of the metal hydride tanks.

	abstract = {Metal hydride (MH) hydrogen storage systems have gained interest as an efficient and safe method for hydrogen storage. An extremely high chemical reaction rate and rapid heat transfer should be the characteristics of an ideal metal hydride reactor (MHR). However, the thermal conductivity of a metal hydride bed (MHB) is only 0.1-1.5 W m−1 K−1, which poses a challenge in practical applications and makes it urgent to adopt an efficient thermal management approach. This paper reviews the development of the MHB thermal management over the past few decades, which can be divided into three parts: (1) from the MHR structure, methods like adding cooling tubes and fins are adopted to enhance the heat transfer between the MHR and the outside environment; (2) from the material perspective, thermal conductivity enhancers that include metal foams and expanded natural graphite (ENG) are introduced to the MHB to improve the effective thermal conductivity of the MHB; and (3) a phase change material (PCM) is employed to strengthen the heat transformation inside the MHB and reduce the energy loss. This research is focused on evaluating the impact of various thermal management measures on heat and mass transfer and comparing their heat transfer effectiveness, summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of different MHR structures. Finally, some views on the future designs of MHBs are proposed. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is one of the most promising renewable energies that has been observing rapid development over the past years. Recent accidental explosion incidents and the associated damages have demonstrated the importance of hydrogen safety against potential explosions. This article presents a systematic review on hydrogen explosions. Potential explosion scenarios including the existence of impurities and rich-oxygen environment in the production, storage with extreme-high pressure and ultra-low temperature, transportation, and consumption processes are reviewed. Different types of hydrogen-air cloud explosion include expansion and deflagration, detonation, and deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT). Existing studies on hydrogen explosion covering laboratory and field blasting test, numerical simulation utilizing various computational approaches, and theoretical derivation are reviewed and summarized. CFD modeling is currently one of the main research methods because of its cost effectiveness, though challenges existing in simulation hydrogen-air cloud detonation comparing with testing results. Apart from the properties of hydrogen-air cloud such as concentration, size and heterogeneity, environmental factors such as ignition, ventilation and obstacle are found to strongly influence the loading characteristics of hydrogen-air cloud explosion. Existing prediction approaches for estimating blast loading from hydrogen-air cloud explosion including the TNT equivalent method (TNT-EM), TNO multi-energy method (TNO MEM), and Baker-Strehlow-Tang method (BST) are primarily empirical based. Because of the inherited difference of hydrogen-air cloud from solid explosives and conventional flammable gases, the accuracies of these approaches are still doubtable, which requires further study. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are considered a promising hydrogen storage technology. Heat must be exchanged with an external medium, such as a heat transfer fluid, for the required chemical reactions to occur. Batch reactors are simple but useful solutions for small-scale storage applications, which can be modelled with a lumped-parameter approach, adequately reproducing their dynamic performance. For such reactors, power is consumed to circulate the external heat transfer fluid and stir the organic liquid inside the reactor, and heat transfer performance and power consumption are two key parameters in reactor optimisation. Therefore, with reference to the hydrogen release phase, this paper describes a procedure to optimise the reactor thermal design, based on a lumped-parameter model, in terms of heat transfer performance and minimum power consumption. Two batch reactors are analysed: a conventional jacketed reactor with agitation nozzles and a half-pipe coil reactor. Heat transfer performance is evaluated by introducing a newly defined dimensionless parameter, the Heat Transfer Ratio (HTR), whose value directly correlates to the heat rate required by the carrier's dehydrogenation reaction. The resulting model is a valid tool for adequately reproducing the hydrogen storage behaviour within dynamic models of complex and detailed energy systems. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The uneven distribution of renewable energy resources and different levels of development have produced a large amount of abandoned electricity. Hydrogen production from the electrolysis of water can effectively consume abandoned electricity. And hydrogen energy has been hailed as the ultimate energy source in the 21st century. However, the many branches of the industry have made the overall layout of local hydrogen energy a tricky issue. Therefore, combining the characteristics and development status, and pilot project data, this article selects three typical hydrogen energy industry routes with high development potential for focused study. These three routes cover the main hydrogen production, storage and transportation technologies, and hydrogen energy application scenarios. A modeling-based approach is applied to calculate the energy utilization and economics of each route. The analysis is then combined with the current development status to obtain the advantages and disadvantages, suitable conditions, and development potential of each route. Among the three routes, the PEMFC route has the highest energy efficiency of 46.6% but is less economical. Suitable for construction in and around power plants to improve energy utilization. The hydrogen transportation route has a lower energy utilization rate of 34.9%. However, this route is more economical, with a conservative estimate of hydrogen refueling cost of about 60 RMB/kg at the current demonstration level. Suitable for medium and large cities with mature hydrogen energy development. The transportation cost of pipeline hydrogen transportation is low, but the preliminary pipeline construction and modification are more complicated. Based on the research results and local conditions, the government or enterprises can personalize the design of the hydrogen energy industry chain faster and more effectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), have the effect of raising the Earth's temperature. To combat this issue and reduce carbon emissions, it is advisable to shift towards the widespread utilization of cleaner fuels, such as hydrogen. The establishment of a global-scale hydrogen economy, coupled with hydrogen geological storage, presents a viable solution to meet the world's energy demands while accommodating peak usage periods. In geological hydrogen (H2) storage, the rock formation wetting characteristics are essential to regulate fluid dynamics, injection rates, the spread of gas within the rock matrix, and safety considerations. The wetting characteristics of minerals within the rock are significantly influenced by geological factors. To assess the wetting behavior of a mineral/H2/brine system under geo-storage conditions, innovative approaches have emerged. This research utilized a combination of advanced machine learning models, such as fully connected neural networks, adaptive gradient boosting, random forests, decision trees, and extreme gradient boosting to forecast the wettability characteristics of a ternary system comprising hydrogen (H2), brine, and specific rock minerals (namely quartz and mica). The predictions were made under various conditions, including different pressures ranging from 0 to 25 MPa, temperatures spanning from 308 to 343 K, and salinities of 10 wt.% NaCl solution. The machine learning models demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting mineral/H2/brine system's wettability (contact angles, advancing and receding). Incorporation of various experimental values have established correlations based on ML techniques. The performance and reliability of these models were rigorously assessed using statistical methods and graphical analyses. The deployed ML models consistently provided accurate predictions of wettability across diverse operational scenarios. Notably, the suggested model exhibited a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.214 during training and 0.810 during testing. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis revealed that pressure exerted the most significant influence on mineral/H2/brine system's wettability. These ML model outcomes can be effectively utilized to anticipate hydrogen geological storage capacities and ensure the security of restraint in large-scale developments.

This review reveals that previous studies in these areas have focused primarily on improving plug placement and durability without significant consideration of the potential for long term development of leakage paths in the old wellbore infrastructure (cement and casing) whose surfaces remain exposed to reservoir fluids below the permanent plug after conventional P and A. The need for a new approach to plug and abandonment materials selection and reengineering of materials placement methods to ensure permanent isolation of reservoir fluids from existing well infrastructure is herein identified especially as the stock of wells nearing their end of life grows on a global scale. A summary of studies in the accelerated degradation of Portland cement in the presence of corrosive reservoir fluid under high temperature and pressure conditions is also presented. This will significantly drive research in materials selection for alternative barrier as HPHT wells mature for permanent abandonment. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {To achieve carbon neutrality in the industrial sector, variable low-carbon and low-cost electricity sources, together with a variety of storage technologies, maybe the only viable path. Here, we investigate the diverse scenarios for manufacturing facilities (MF) under different emission reduction targets to determine the least-cost decarbonization pathway. This study developed a multi-energy model to assess emission reduction versus cost ratio and gave a technology roadmap for MF, i.e., cost-effectiveness of each technology at a given decarbonization level. We optimized the dispatch of each scenario with the least cost objective and step-wise reduced the emissions of selected exemplar European MF from current levels until the solution came out as infeasible due to the lifecycle emissions of considered technologies. Results showed that electrical boiler became key technology from 10% emission reduction target (ERT), while battery storage is cost-effective for medium ERT and H2 facility remains a critical part of achieving deep decarbonization targets (>80%). This analysis reveals a basic understanding of a given technology's economic viability to target a certain decarbonization goal and would help guide MF that are more inclined to invest in having their green energy distributed system. Sensitivity analysis of key parameter values (i.e., grid electricity/gas prices, technology costs) reveals that the H2 facility will play a critical role in deep decarbonization and high gas prices made the expensive heat pumps cost-effective in all scenarios. Furthermore, the future costs of electrolyzer, fuel cell, heat pump, and battery storage will decide the technological transformation speed for the industrial sector. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The intermittency of renewable energy sources necessitates energy storage to meet the full demand and balancing requirements of the grid. Green hydrogen (H2) is a chemical energy carrier that can be used in a flexible manner and store large amounts of energy for long periods of time. This techno-economic analysis investigates H2 production from wind using commercially available desalination and electrolysis units. Proton exchange membrane and alkaline electrolyser units are utilised and compared. The intermittency of wind is examined, with comparison against grid-bought electricity. A model is developed to determine the selling price required to ensure profitability over a 10-year period. Firstly, where H2 is produced using energy from the grid, with electricity purchased when below a specified price point or between specified hours. In the second scenario a wind turbine is owned by the user and the electricity price is not considered, while the turbine capital expenditure is. The price of H2 production from wind is found to be comparable with natural gas derived H2 at a larger scale, with a minimum selling price calculated to be 4.85 £/kg at a setpoint of 500 kg of H2/hr. At a setpoint of 50 kg of H2/hr, this is significantly higher at 12.10 £/kg. In both cases, the alkaline electrolyser produced cheaper H2. This study demonstrates an economy of scale with H2 prices decreasing with increased scale. H2 prices are also closely linked to the capital expenditure, with the equipment size, space and safety identified as limiting factors. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The large-scale deployments of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and hydrogen (H2) require the installation of costly carbon dioxide (CO2) and H2 pipeline infrastructures. As the future demands for CO2 and H2 pipeline transportation are expected to increase substantially, this paper examines the economics of installing adequately oversized infrastructures. We analytically show that the underlying engineering equations de facto define Cobb-Douglas production functions for both fluids. We then use these production functions to determine the cost-minimizing decisions of a pipeline operator and infer the optimal ratio of oversizing. From a policymaking perspective, this ratio indicates whether the level of oversizing envisioned by the operator is consistent with its expectations of future demand (and thus, by contrast, whether it is attempting to overcapitalize and exploit a regulatory flaw). As the anticipations of the operator may fail to materialize, we opt for a minimax regret perspective and compare the performances of the operator's investment decisions under alternative demand trajectories. Our study shows that the conservative recommendation to build for the proven demand only is systematically regret-maximizing. Consequently, an infrastructure push would likely contribute to overcoming the chicken and egg problem and thus support the large-scale deployment of these emerging technologies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Cement is fundamental to maintaining integrity throughout the life of a well by preventing leakage of fluids. Cement is thus crucial in oil and natural gas producing wells as well as in wells used for storage and utilization of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Even if the cement slurry has been properly placed, changes in downhole reservoir conditions can induce thermal and mechanical stresses to harm the integrity of the cement sheath. This work presents a novel apparatus to analyze the cement sheath performance at simulated reservoir conditions of pressure, temperature, and wellbore configuration. One of the major features demonstrated is three-dimensional (3D) monitoring of in-situ dynamic changes in cement using acoustic data. 3D density profiles allow visual observance of the evolution of possible settling over the cement curing process. A first arrival pick time decrease of 26.6% is observed over a 15-h curing time. Confinement improves the strength of cement as seen by decrease in travel time (10.8%) and increase of amplitude (32%) with 15 MPa confining pressure increase. Temperature increase of 66.4 °C has damaging effects on the strength of cement as seen by increase (11.9%) in travel time and decrease (20.5%) in amplitude. An increase in cement shear bond strength from 13% to 89.7% with longer curing time is measured using this device. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper highlights the significance of optimizing district energy systems with solar prosumers from an exergy-based perspective to minimize carbon dioxide emission responsibilities. As a case study, the Dezonnet solar district energy project in Haarlem, the Netherlands, which incorporates solar prosumers with traditional rooftop photovoltaic-thermal panels, and heat pumps, integrated with a district heating network featuring a seasonal central thermal storage aquifer, is critically examined. This paper shows that the project has carbon dioxide emission responsibilities that can only be revealed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. A novel extension of this law relates carbon dioxide emission responsibilities with major exergy destructions. As an alternative solution, a solar/green hydrogen house concept is presented, which encompasses advanced, pumpless photovoltaic-thermal panels with heat pipes, solar flat-plate panels, and thermo-electric generator layers in a sandwiched construction with phase-change thermal storage blocks. On-site seasonal thermal storage systems utilizing phase change material and biogas generation replace the large-scale district aquifer. New optimization constraints as well as the objective function of minimum exergy destruction and corresponding emission responsibility equations are presented. Sample studies indicate that the alternative solution may reduce carbon dioxide emissions responsibility by up to 95%. This paper concludes that smaller districts or individual solar homes with advanced technologies are preferable. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

In this study, V80Ti8Cr12 alloys are tailor-made to meet the RAPS and MPS working conditions (293–323 K and 0.2–2 MPa). The effects of pulverization methods and particle sizes on the alloy's hydrogen storage properties have been systematically investigated. In addition, a novel Pressure-Composition-Isotherm approach is employed for the first time to accurately evaluate the hydrogen storage capacities. The reduction of particle size enhances the absorption kinetics due to the increased surface area. However, mechanical pulverization causes lattice distortion that decreases the hydrogen absorption capacity and desorption rate. In contrast, hydrogen embrittlement can effectively pulverize the alloys without generating lattice distortion. The results reveal that 5 mm sample, which is simply subjected to hydrogen embrittlement, achieves the largest usable hydrogen storage capacity up to 2.1 wt% and the fastest hydrogen desorption rate of ∼4 sccm/g that is nine times quicker than required for RAPS and MPS applications. After 500 cycles, the 5 mm alloy retains 90 % of its capacity, demonstrating excellent durability. Hence, 5 mm hydrogen-embrittled V80Ti8Cr12 alloy is an ideal hydrogen storage material in RAPS and MPS systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The path to European climate neutrality by 2050 will require comprehensive changes in all areas of life. For large industries such as steelworks, this results in the need for climate-friendly technologies. However, the age structure of existing steelworks makes transitional solutions such as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) necessary as short-term measures. Hence, a purposeful option is the integration of technical syntheses such as methanation into the overall process. This work summarizes hydrogen-intensified methanation experiments with synthetic steel gases in the novel additively manufactured reactor ‘ADDmeth1’. The studies include steady-state operating points at various reactor loads. Blast furnace gas (BFG), basic oxygen furnace gas (BOFG) and three mixtures of these two gases serve as carbon sources. The methanation achieved methane yields of 93.5% for BFG and 95.0% for BOFG in the one-stage once-through setup. The results suggest a kinetic limitation in the case of BFG methanation, while an equilibrium limitation is likely for BOFG. There is a smooth transition in all respects between the two extreme cases. The reaction channel inlet temperature (Formula presented.) showed a large influence on the reactor ignition behavior. By falling below the threshold value, a blow-off occurred during experimental operation. By means of a simulation model, practical operating maps were created which characterize permissible operating ranges for (Formula presented.) as a function of the gas composition and the reactor load. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) is an emerging technology which aims to store terawatt-scale energy in the subsurface to alleviate daily and seasonal fluctuations in the ever-increasing renewable energy market. Depleted gas reservoirs and aquifers will be the main targets of storage which requires an understanding of the interaction between formation or cushion gas with native brine. A comprehensive comparison of the petrophysical and two-phase flow properties of the hydrogen-water, methane-water and nitrogen-water systems at in-situ conditions is the focus of our work. We conduct steady-state relative permeability experiments at 2.13 MPa and 298 K using identical capillary numbers of Nc=2.92×10−7 for all three systems. The saturation and in-situ contact angles are determined with segmentation of 3D micro-CT images. The contact angle of each system is almost identical at the irreducible water saturation, Swi, 44°, 46°, 45°, respectively, as is the interfacial tension of 72.0, 71.5 and 71mN/m, respectively. The capillary pressure-saturation relationships for each system have a maximum difference of 3.8 % which leads to approximately equivalent relative permeability in the Bentheimer sandstone core. The end-point relative permeabilities are krg 0=0.049, krg 0=0.045 and krg 0=0.062 at irreducible water saturations of Swi=0.24, Swi=0.25 and Swi=0.23, respectively. All three gases demonstrate equivalent flow properties which indicates that both nitrogen and methane are suitable analogue gases for laboratory multiphase flow experiments and cushion gas to improve safety and the economics of commercial UHS projects. The results enable history matched depleted gas reservoir performance to be used as a guide for UHS. © 2023},

	abstract = {The permeability of CO2 sequestration is influenced by the characteristics of pore–fracture structures in coal, yet the flow simulation via the pore network model (PNM) and the controls of topology and morphology on permeability remain to be understood. First, the pore–fracture structure of high-volatile bituminous coal (HVBC) is characterized using micro-computed tomography, and the flow characteristics of single-phase CO2 in the connected pore–fracture network are simulated by the PNM. Second, the surface roughness of the connected pore–fracture is extracted by fractal characterization, and morphological algorithms are applied to accurately present the pore–fracture network structure. Finally, the implications of structural parameters (pore or throat diameter, coordination number, tortuosity, and sphericity) on CO2 transport are discussed, and the mechanism of pore–fracture structure response due to mineral dissolution in CO2 injection is analyzed. The results shows that the HVBC sample provides significant pore–fracture space (porosity of 10.87%) and flow path (connectivity of 66.50%) for hydrogen and carbon storage. CO2 flow simulation results demonstrate anisotropic flow, with higher CO2 permeability observed in the Z-axis direction (0.061 × 10−3 μm2) compared to the X- and Y-axis directions (0.044 × 10−3 μm2 and 0.059 × 10−3 μm2, respectively). Moreover, the fractures perpendicular to the coal bedding plane in the coal seam with a large tectonic dip strongly influence the flow of CO2 injection. Fractal analysis reveals a positive correlation between fractal dimension and porosity, indicating that structures with higher surface roughness are not convenient for CO2 transport. Significant pore angle characteristics (sphericity average of 0.58), high pore–throat connectivity (coordination number average of 4.31), and low capillary resistance (tortuosity average of 1.19) collectively affect the flow of CO2. Overall, the strongly anisotropic pore–fracture structure contributes to the inhomogeneous flow pattern in CO2 geosequestration. Changes in pore–fracture structure resulting from mineral dissolution during the early stage of CO2–coal matrix interaction in the HVBC reservoir can significantly enhance storage potential. This study contributes to the existing understanding of flow characteristics and provides insights for optimizing CO2 injection efficiency in carbon geosequestration. © 2023},

	abstract = {Underground Hydrogen Storage in Reservoirs (UHSR) is promising for long-term and large-scale renewable energy storage, yet improvements in capacity and efficiency are still highly demanded, which requires a deep understanding of the pore-scale mechanisms. Here, we investigate UHSR using micromodels and discover three pore-scale mechanisms, namely the preferential-to-uniform flow transformation, floating flow, and dead-end pore invasion. Preferential flows ensure the base storage capacity and the early transformation to uniform flows promotes the storage efficiency. Floating flow not only enhances the flow transformation but also increases the storage capacity via its facilitation for dead-end pore invasion. We also provide pore-scale mechanism-based elucidation for the effects of pore heterogeneity, injection flux, and oil/brine distribution on storage capacity and efficiency. Injection flux affects the preferential and floating flows to regulate the rate of base storage and determine whether controlling the flow profile or breaking through the outlet via inertia induced preferential flow. Pore heterogeneity affects the proportion of dynamic dead-end pores and possibility of breaking through via capillary induced preferential flow. In comparison with brine saturated condition, the oil saturated condition is unfavorable of floating flow and dead-end invasion. We propose that brine saturated initial condition with high injection flux and median pore heterogeneity are optimal for both UHSR capacity and efficiency from our micromodel study. We further optimize the capacity from 50 % to 95 % and the efficiency from 7.4 × 10-2 kg/(m3·s) to 2.1 × 10-1 kg/(m3·s) according to revealed mechanisms and influencing factors. From the microscale perspective, this work brings critical insights for enhancing and broadening the application of UHSR engineering practice. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage represents an innovative approach to energy storage. To ensure the secure operation of subterranean hydrogen storage strings, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology was employed to devise an erosion assessment model tailored for high-velocity conditions. The research delved into the erosion and abrasion dynamics of these storage strings when subjected to high-speed gas flows. This study further examined the impacts of gas velocity, particle size, pipe material, and pipe wall corrosion imperfections on flow patterns and erosion wear rates across the column. The outcomes revealed several noteworthy trends. As fluid velocity increased, the flow field’s maximum pressure augmented, while it decreased alongside enlarging pipe diameter and particle size. P110 pipe material exhibited higher maximum pressure in comparison to N80. The effect of centrifugal force induced pressure to surge from the inner to the outer portion of the column. In the curved pipe section’s outer wall, the frequent occurrence of high-angle collisions engendered elevated rates of erosion wear over time. Particularly noteworthy was the observation of the highest erosion rate in curved pipes showcasing three corrosion defects, attributed to the backflow effects of erosion pits. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A large-scale oil-heating type Mg-based hydrogen storage tank is the key device for the high-efficiency and high-safety Mg-based solid hydrogen storage and transportation. However, the complicated heat and mass transfer in the Mg alloy bed and oil tube during the hydrogen desorption process impede the design of high-performance hydrogen storage tanks. In this work, a one- and three-dimensional coupled model considering the impact of oil velocity and temperature on the internal heat and mass transfer was developed to simulate the hydrogen desorption process of large-scale oil-heating type Mg-based hydrogen storage tanks. This model was then solved by the finite element method, and the simulation results agreed well with the experimental data obtained from an Mg-based hydrogen storage tank. Moreover, simulation results indicate that the oil velocity has a considerable impact on the hydrogen desorption performance of the Mg-based hydrogen storage tank, and a recommended oil velocity of 4 m s−1 was identified. In addition, high oil temperature and low hydrogen desorption pressure benefit the hydrogen desorption performance, thus should be determined by the application scenarios. Besides, the complete hydrogen desorption time was barely affected by the initial bed temperature, which is suggested as ≥ 573 K to meet the high rate requirement of hydrogen supply, otherwise as room temperature to reduce energy costs. The model and simulation results presented in this work provided a foundation for the design of high performance large-scale oil-heating type Mg-based hydrogen storage tanks that can be applied practically in the field of hydrogen energy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Utilization and transportation of hydrogen energy are considered an inevitable trend toward achieving global zero CO2 emission. It is predicted that the utilization and storage of natural gas and hydrogen will be one of the hotspots in the coming years. With this aim, large-scale transportation of hydrogen-blended natural gas, which significantly reduces carbon emissions and gas transportation costs, serves as a prerequisite. However, with a covalent radius of 0.37 Å, the permeation of H atoms into pipeline steel is unavoidable, seriously threatening long-term service safety. The hydrogen effect (H-effect) processes, including physical/chemical adsorption, dissociation, and dissolution diffusion have long been studied for many years. Various materials improvements and environmental control procedures have been continuously applied to hinder the H-effect. This review focused on three aspects of H-effect elimination and how it affects material degradation. The microstructure strategies include elemental alloying and heat treatment, which can change the microstructure of pipeline steels. The surface treatments include shot peening and electroplating. Shot peening can lead to enhanced residual compressive stress and plastic deformation. Meanwhile, electroplating can be used in conjunction with shot peening. The last strategy, cathodic protection, is closely related to hydrogen concentration, temperature, microorganisms, alternating current and so on. Finally, the outlook of the H-effect of pipeline steels with consideration of marine and polar soil environments has been proposed. The aim of this review was to provide technical support for reducing the H-effect in hydrogen-blended natural gas transportation, so as to accelerate the realization of global zero CO2 emission. © 2023},

Considering this fact and taking into account energy, economic, and environmental factors, this study provides the best possible setup of a novel combined cooling, heating, power, and water (CCHPW) system for coastal areas by employing response surface methodology (RSM) and TRNSYS simulation. This multi-component multi-generation system comprises photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors, a heat pump, a desiccant wheel, fuel cells, a reverse osmosis system, a battery, and a hydrogen storage unit. The system is dynamically simulated in the TRNSYS environment. The impacts of the selected design parameters on the techno-economic-environmental performances of the system are investigated after the RSM identifies the ideal configuration. The results for the weather conditions and consumption patterns of Dubai and Barcelona (as the two case studies) indicate that the total electricity consumption of the system can be reduced by 72.3% and 64.6% compared to the base system, respectively. Besides, the total environmental damage of the system is diminished by 29.2% for Dubai and 8.1% for Barcelona compared to the base system.

	abstract = {Solid-state hydrogen storage based on metal hydrides is considered a promising method for hydrogen storage. However, the low inherent thermal conductivity of metal hydride powder significantly limits the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation process in the metal hydride bed. Accurate measurement and improvement of the effective thermal conductivity of a hydride bed is of great significance for design of solid-state hydrogen storage devices. This article analyzes the factors that influence the effective thermal conductivity of a metal hydride bed, and also introduces different measurement methods and improvement ways for the effective thermal conductivity of a metal hydride bed. It is an effective way to improve the thermal conductivity of metal hydride beds by hydride powder mixed with a high thermal conductivity material and compaction. Accurately measuring the influence of hydrogen pressure, temperature and hydrogen storage capacity and other factors on the effective thermal conductivity of a metal hydride bed and obtaining the numerical equation of effective thermal conductivity play an important role in guiding the optimization design of heat and mass transfer structure of metal hydride hydrogen storage devices. The transient plane source method seems to be a better measurement choice because of short test time and easy to establish a pressure-tight and temperature control test system. However, there is still a lack of testing standards for the thermal conductivity of the hydride bed, as well as suggestions for the selection of test methods, improvement ways and design of in situ test room. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The thermo-viscoplastic constitutive model and fluid-structure coupling approach are incorporated in the modeling. The radial displacement/vibration histories and the effective strain responses of different layers were analyzed to demonstrate the potential deformation of the shell structure.

	abstract = {The use of polymer nanocomposites is ubiquitous in every industry. The high corrosion resistance and chemical durability of CNT/Epoxy nanocomposites make them suitable for chemical plants, oil industries, and hydrogen storage. However, unexpected failures have been reported for chemicals that unavoidably penetrate, provoking deterioration and degradation of the composite constituents. Conventional methods are impractical for evaluating structural health conditions because they often require disassembly of the structure and complex post-processing analysis. Contactless material characterization methods, on the other hand, are rather promising tools. Nevertheless, the influence of nanofillers and acid attack diffusion on wireless signals has yet to be explored. In this study, the effects of acid attack periods (i.e. one, week, two weeks, and month) on the scattering parameters of microstrip antennas were investigated using a vector network analys. Additionally, an idealised multi-scale modelling approach was developed to study the influence of electrical conductivity and porosity volume changes on return loss (S11). The data showed that the diffusion of ions altered the specimen properties as time progressed. The increment in the electrical conductivity and porosity volume is reflected especially during the month-long period. Finally, in this study, it was found that wireless methods can be implemented to characterise materials which are beneficial for real-time in-situ structural health monitoring. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Natural gas plays a vital role in the economically and environmentally sustainable future of energy. Its reliable deliveries are required, especially nowadays, when the energy market is so volatile and unstable. The conversion of natural gas to its liquefied form (LNG) allows its transport in greater quantities. Affordability and reliability of clean energy is a key issue even for developed markets. Therefore, natural gas usage enables to implement green solutions into countries’ economies. However, the LNG-production process consumes a considerable amount of energy. This energy is stored in LNG as cold energy. After LNG unloading into storage tanks at receiving terminals, it is vaporised and compressed for transmission to a natural gas pipeline system. During the regasification process, the large part of the energy stored in LNG may be recovered and used for electricity generation, seawater desalination, cryogenic air separation, hydrogen liquefaction, material freezing, carbon dioxide capture, as well as for combined LNG cold energy utilization systems. Moreover, increased efficiency of LNG terminals may attract potential clients. In the presented paper, a mathematical model is performed to determine the influence of LNG composition and regasification process parameters on the quantity of released LNG cold energy in a large-scale floating storage and regasification units (FSRU)-type terminal “Independence” (Lithuania). Flow rate of LNG regasification, pressure, and boil-off gas recondensation have been considered. Possibilities to reduce the energy losses were investigated to find the ways to improve the regasification process efficiency for real FSRU. The results analysis revealed that potential of LNG cold energy at FSRU could vary from 20 to 25 MW. A utilisation of industrial and urban waste heat for the heat sink FSRU is recommended to increase the energy efficiency of the whole regasification process. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {There is no doubt that greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2, needs to be reduced to mitigate the effects of climate change. While carbon management can be achieved through a number of technological and engineering approaches ranging from energy efficiency (i.e., highly energy integrated system and process intensification) to renewable energy (wind, solar, hydrogen), CO2 capture & storage (CCS) has been identified as having a key role in the energy transition. Captured anthropogenic CO2 can be permanently stored in saline aquifers and depleted reservoirs. Saline aquifers (normally unsuitable for industrial or human exploitation) offer the largest storage capacity; however, there is, usually, lack of geological characterization leading to high risks due to large uncertainty. On the other hand, depleted gas fields, close to economical life cessation, are deemed an excellent alternative as safe and long-term storage is already proven and immense geological characterisation has been gathered during production life. Moreover, there is great potential to repurpose the existing offshore infrastructure (pipelines, platforms, and wells) as to minimize capital expenditure and delaying decommissioning costs. Repurposing existing production systems can also be an efficient way to achieve rapid deployment of CCS at large scale. In this paper, we present the key engineering challenges, risks, and opportunities in the re-use of existing oil and gas offshore infrastructure for CO2 transport and injection. We highlight the complex operational constraints and interactions between different components of the transportation network. The design and operation of the transportation network is governed by the following drivers: • Safe design • Robust and flexible operation • Minimize cost (or delay expenditure as long as possible) • Minimize emissions of greenhouse gases associated to the operation of the transport network (i.e., energy efficiency) • Start operation with minimum modifications.

To simulate the hydrogen absorption process, we first validated the numerical models based on the finite element method. Then we investigated the effect of device geometry and turbulent flow of cooling water on the absorption performance. The optimized device with 5 mm fin height, 2 mm fin length and 13 fins was obtained, and the absorption time for 0.8 wt% saturation level was reduced by 32% compared with the traditional device with circular fins. It is found that the turbulent flow of cooling water has a great effect on enhancing the hydrogenation rate, and critical Reynolds number is 11,860. The heat transfer resistance drops from 0.140 K/W to 0.023 K/W when Reynolds number increases from 1780 to 11,860. Furthermore, the optimal turbulence modeling strategy was analyzed in detail. The predictions derived from the L-VEL model with wall distance initialization are far more accurate than those of other turbulence models and have the lowest computational time of 2118 s.

Large-eddy simulation turbulent combustion model is adopted to explain the interaction between flame front, turbulent flow, and pressure wave.

Numerical simulation reproduces the vented hydrogen–air explosion and provides further understanding of the mechanism of external explosion. The influence of vent burst pressure on the vented explosion is also studied using simulated flame temperature, flow velocity, and pressure history. The simulation result reproduces internal pressure details accurately. Flame front propagation velocity shows four different processes in experimental and simulated flame images.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is one of the energy carriers that has started to play a significant role in the clean energy transition. In the hydrogen ecosystem, storing hydrogen safely and with high volumetric density plays a key role. In this regard, metal hydride storage seems to be superior to compressed gas storage, which is the most common method used today. However, thermal management is a challenge that needs to be considered. Temperature changes occur during charging and discharging processes due to the reactions between metal, metal hydride, and hydrogen, which affect the inflow or outflow of hydrogen at the desired flow rate. There are different thermal management techniques to handle this challenge in the literature. When the metal hydride storage tanks are used in integrated systems together with a fuel cell and/or an electrolyzer, the thermal interactions between these components can be used for this purpose. This study gives a comprehensive review of the heat transfer during the charging and discharging of metal hydride tanks, the thermal management system techniques used for metal hydride tanks, and the studies on the thermal management of metal hydride tanks with material streams from the fuel cell and/or electrolyzers. © 2022 by the authors.},

The number of tubes MH tubes which is seven in the present case was selected on the basis of highest heat transfer capacity per unit system weight. The reactor performance was simulated under varying operating conditions. It was observed that reactor performance was quiet promising at a moderate supply pressure of 35 bar and a heat transfer fluid flow rate of as low as 30 lpm. Any increase in flow rate does not alter the reactor performance significantly. Initial bed temperature did not have any significant effect on the system performance.

	abstract = {Liquid hydrogen has potential as a storage vector for large-scale hydrogen transportation. Hydrogen liquefaction is however a highly energy intensive process, particularly due to the necessary exothermic spin-isomer conversion from ortho- to parahydrogen. We explore the operation of the main cryogenic plate-fin heat-exchangers (PFHXs) used in hydrogen liquefaction; simultaneous dynamic processes occurring within the PFHX include the heterogeneously catalysed spin-isomer conversion, heat transfer and pressure loss. In this work, these coupled processes are simulated for a 100 tonne/day hydrogen reactant cooled by a helium refrigerant in a PFHX. For the process configuration utilised in this work, a reactor volume of 24.0 m3 and a coolant flow rate of 600 tonne/day were necessary to achieve and outlet parahydrogen fraction of 0.99. Pressure drop through the PFHX packed bed was consistently negligible. We also explored the sensitivity towards model parameters. The outlet parahydrogen fraction is determined to be considerably (∼10 times) more sensitive to reaction rate kinetics relative to heat transfer: therefore, the reactor geometry will be primarily determined by conversion kinetics. The current quantitative understanding of these rate kinetics is however limited. Future experimental research thus needs to focus on quantifying ortho- to parahydrogen kinetics.

	abstract = {The anticipated upscaling of hydrogen energy applications will involve the storage and transport of hydrogen at cryogenic conditions. Understanding the potential hazard arising from leaks in high-pressure cryogenic storage is needed to improve hydrogen safety. The manuscript reports a series of numerical simulations with detailed chemistry for the transient evolution of ignited high-pressure cryogenic hydrogen jets. The study aims to gain insight of the ignition processes, flame structures and dynamics associated with the transient flame evolution. Numerical simulations were firstly conducted for an unignited jet released under the same cryogenic temperature of 80 K and pressure of 200 bar as the considered ignited jets. The predicted hydrogen concentrations were found to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The results informed the subsequent simulations of the ignited jets involving four different ignition locations. The predicted time series snapshots of temperature, hydrogen mass fraction and the flame index are analyzed to study the transient evolution and structure of the flame. The results show that a diffusion combustion layer is developed along the outer boundary of the jet and a side diffusion flame is formed for the near-field ignition. For the far-field ignition, an envelope flame is observed. The flame structure contains a diffusion flame on the outer edge and a premixed flame inside the jet. Due to the complex interactions between turbulence, fuel-air mixing at cryogenic temperature and chemical reactions, localized spontaneous ignition and transient flame extinguishment are observed. The predictions also captured the experimentally observed deflagration waves in the far-field ignited jets. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Although heat management during hydrogen adsorption/desorption in metal hydride (MH) reactor using phase change material (PCMs)-based energy storage system has been researched in the last years, very limited data on large-scale applications is found. In this work, a 2D transient numerical model has been developed on Fluent 15.0 CFD platform to assess the performance of hydrogen desorption with consuming heat reduction in a large-scale metal-hydride (MH) storage reactor packed with LaNi5 and 4 MF-PCM (i.e. Metal Foam-Phase Change Material) tubes distributed in the MH-bed. The model was firstly validated by comparing the simulation outcomes with experimental data from other works. Mass and heat transfer resulted in the different parts of the cylindrical MH-MF-PCM reactor were analyzed; where the temporal temperature and energy profiles (average and contours), the MH-dehydrogenation kinetics, and the PCM solidification rate were established for different MFs (i.e. aluminum, copper, nickel and titanium) of varying porosities (10 to 100%). Outstanding results were found. The MF-PCM unit enhanced the MH performance (dehydrogenation) by discharging its latent heat to the MH-bed. The MH was completely discharged within ~700 s. Metal foams accelerated the PCM-solidification rate and the heat releasing to the MH, mainly when lower MF porosities are adopted (i.e. increasing the thermal conductivity of the PCM). The lower the MF porosity (the higher the conductivity), the higher is the energy lost during the sonification process. The PCM solidified rapidly with copper and aluminium MFs instead of nickel and titanium (thermal conductivity effect), with strong dependence on the tubes' position in the reactor bed. The PCM-tube above the H2-charging/discharging pipe solidifies more quickly than the other tubes, presumably to the gravitational effect. In conclusion, the solidification progress of the PCM in the different MF systems was markedly improved in the presence of lower porous MF of higher conductivity (Al and Cu), where the tube position plays a crucial role. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wellbore decommissioning is the final stage in the life cycle of any oil or gas well and involves placing acceptable well barriers to seal the wellbore. Operators have the obligation to decommission wells safely once they reach the end of their life. This study explores the prospects of repurposing near-to-decommission wellbores for pipe storage, forming a hydrogen-based energy storage system for containing hydrogen produced from surplus renewable electricity. It offers two pathways for hydrogen consumption, 1) Power-to-Hydrogen and 2) Power-to-Power. A conceptual design is presented to repurpose a wellbore into pipe storage to store hydrogen in its gaseous form. The storability of the pipe depends on pipe characteristics, including diameter and length as well as working pressure. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to calculate levelized cost of storage (LCOS) and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) for the proposed method. The LCOS is in the range of 1.33 A$/(kgH2) and 1.66 A$/(kgH2). LCOH including the storage cost is obtained to be in the range of 5.22 A$/(kgH2) and 6.50 A$/(kgH2). This system can potentially integrate green hydrogen into local economies by managing decommissioning costs for the creation of a storage solution for green hydrogen. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage is the biggest challenge towards the widespread utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier. One of the methods is solid-state storage of hydrogen in the metal hydride, which is safe, volumetrically efficient, and involves an optimal set of operating conditions. However, designing reactors for metal hydride storage involves much thermal management since the absorption and desorption are exothermic and endothermic reactions, respectively. Many optimization and simulations are involved before arriving at a suitable metal hydride reactor design for a particular application. This study focuses on developing easy-to-use design charts to evaluate reaction fractions inside the metal hydride bed for various combinations of parameters. First, the parameters affecting the reaction fraction are selected, and the range for each of these parameters is defined. The dependence of each parameter on the reaction fraction is analysed, maintaining the mean value of the remaining parameters. The LaNi5 is used as a metal hydride for this study. A two-dimensional (2-D) mathematical model is developed to evaluate the effect of these parameters on reaction fraction. Further, based on this detailed parametric study, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the most significant parameters. It was observed from this parametric and sensitivity analysis that among the considered parameters, the volume of the reactor (amount of hydrogen to be stored) and length to diameter ratio have a more dominant effect on the reaction fraction followed by supply pressure and thermal conductivity of metal hydride. However, the external temperature of heat transfer fluid (ie, the ambient temperature) does not significantly affect the reaction fraction. Hence, this parameter is assumed to be constant in developing design charts. Also, based on this analysis, the range of parameters is redefined for design charts. Further, this 2-D mathematical model and parametric and sensitivity analysis are used to develop the design charts. These design charts use the most sensitive parameters and demonstrate the effect of all the other parameters on the reaction fraction. Finally, the method of using these design charts and their accuracy is explained for reaction fraction evaluation for a particular set of parameters. These charts are easy-to-use and accurate for the quick preliminary reaction fraction estimation for metal hydride hydrogen storage system. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Power-to-Power is a process whereby the surplus of renewable power is stored as chemical energy in the form of hydrogen. Hydrogen can be used in situ or transported to the consumption node. When power is needed again, hydrogen can be consumed for power generation. Each of these processes incurs energy losses, leading to a certain round-trip efficiency (Energy Out/Energy In). Round-trip efficiency is calculated considering the following processes; water electrolysis for hydrogen production, compressed, liquefied or metal-hydride for hydrogen storage, fuel-cell-electric-truck for hydrogen distribution and micro-gas turbine for hydrogen power generation. The maximum achievable round-trip efficiency is of 29% when considering solid oxide electrolysis along with metal hydride storage. This number goes sharply down when using either alkaline or proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, 22.2% and 21.8% respectively. Round-trip efficiency is further reduced if considering other storage media, such as compressed- or liquefied-H2. However, the aim of the paper is to highlight there is still a large margin to increase Power-to-Power round-trip efficiency, mainly from the hydrogen production and power generation blocks, which could lead to round-trip efficiencies of around 40%–42% in the next decade for Power-to-Power energy storage systems with micro-gas turbines. © 2022 The Authors},

The most important aspect is the concentration of hydrogen in the fuel mixture, which affects the combustion process of the fuel and determines the optimal operating conditions of the engine. When using methane–hydrogen mixtures with low hydrogen content, the safety measures and risks are similar to those that exist when working with natural gas. Serious logistical problems are associated with the difficulties of using the existing gas distribution infrastructure for transporting methane–hydrogen mixtures. It is possible that, despite the need for huge investments, it will be necessary to create a new infrastructure for the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen and its mixtures with natural gas.

	abstract = {To develop large-scale use of hydrogen as an environmentally sensible alternative to fossil energy sources, the design of safe and innovative storage and transportation infrastructure is a crucial issue. In direct contact with the high-pressure hydrogen, structural materials, especially traditional alloys, are indeed susceptible to degradation of their mechanical properties due to the diffusion of hydrogen atoms into their atomic lattice structure. This phenomenon leads to materials' embrittlement and results in severe damage to the employed components. Therefore, the prevention of hydrogen atom diffusion is one key consideration to avoid its adverse effects on materials' mechanical properties. This paper aims to review the mechanisms and factors responsible for the hydrogen embrittlement phenomenon. The main specifications to fulfill while selecting appropriate materials are hence considered for hydrogen energy uses. Finally, the effective surface modification solutions are reviewed for implementation as a permeation barrier to protect the structural materials from hydrogen degradation. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Large scale of hydrogen storage is needed to balance the energy supply-demand fluctuation issues. Among few of the large scale storage systems, depleted oil and gas wells are widely employed. The construction of wellbore is normally in cylindrical shape and formed by layers of cement, casing and formation. As failure of wellbore is costly, proper structural integrity assessment is essential. In this article, an analytical solution derived based on recursive algorithm for estimating the thermomechanical stresses across the wellbore structure was proposed and verified. The temperature and stresses distribution results obtained from proposed analytical solution were compared with numerical results and they were found in good agreement. The percentage of difference was observed to be less than 0.1%. Besides that, a comparison study was performed on two, four and six layers wellbore structure. It was observed that four and six layers structure can produce much lower tangential tensile stress on the steel casing of the wellbore © 2022. Published by Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage in absorbents as activated carbons has been rarely investigated; however, about 25 years ago, the development of new nanomaterials, initiated by Iijima’s discovery of carbon microtubules, started new hopes. Unfortunately, initial results on high hydrogen uptake in carbon nanotubes at ambient conditions could not be independently reproduced; however, at cryogenic conditions, these novel nanomaterials just behaved as activated carbons with an uptake proportional to the surface area. Shortly after, the development of coordination polymers with permanent porosity opened a new route to nanoporous materials with ultra-high internal surfaces. Mainly metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been attracting a great deal of attention in recent years, as very high gravimetric hydrogen capacities can be achieved at 77 K. Cryogenic storage by physisorption of hydrogen molecules will safely operate at low pressures, is fully reversible, and possesses fast kinetics. This mini-review shows the rapid development in this field over the past 25 years.

	abstract = {As an important link in the industry chain of hydrogen energy, liquid hydrogen has great potential in civil aviation, shipping, and urban public transportation, and is a also key component in the future large-scale industrialization of hydrogen energy. The accuracy of liquid hydrogen flow measurement is crucial in its preparation, storage, transportation, application, and trade settlement during the whole industry chain running. The liquid hydrogen flow standard device is the core equipment to check and calibrate the liquid hydrogen flowmeter, which is the key link to ensure the reliable flow measurement of liquid hydrogen. As a low-temperature fluid with ultra-low viscosity and low density, the non-negligible error would be introduced when the flowmeter is calibrated using other fluids instead such as water, especially in the tiny flow range. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a flow standard device for actual-flow calibration of the liquid hydrogen flowmeters. In this paper, based on the existing research of cryogenic fluid standard devices at home and abroad, a liquid hydrogen flow standard device based on the bi-directional dynamic mass method is designed, using helium to drive the liquid hydrogen in the tank, which can provide the standard flow rate in the small flow range for the calibration and verification of the flowmeter under test. The system is designed to take into account the cryogenic temperature, low viscosity, high flammability and explosivity of the liquid hydrogen, as well as the measurement accuracy. Compared with the cryogenic pump, the high-pressure helium source can provide a more stable and smaller flow rate to achieve the higher accuracy and robustness of the calibration and verification of the flowmeters under the small flow rate of the device. The bi-directional dynamic mass method with reverse drive can avoid the influence of additional pipe capacity on the actual error generated during measurement, effectively reduce the measurement uncertainty of the device and improve the measurement system of the liquid hydrogen flow. © FLOMEKO 2022.All rights reserved},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen plays a major role in the net-zero greenhouse gas-reduction strategy of the European Union. To supply hydrogen as cheap as possible, a well-balanced production system is needed to handle fluctuations of solar radiation and wind energy. Thus, this paper investigates the onsite hydrogen supply costs in the European catchment area in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050. Furthermore, a subsequent transport per pipeline to one of the projected demand centres in Europe (exemplary Germany) is considered. Also, the sensitivity regarding the additional use of salt caverns as hydrogen storage and less restricting supply profiles is assessed as well as the technical annual supply potential for 2030 and 2050. To do so, the optimal system design for minimized hydrogen supply cost for water electrolysis based on photovoltaic and wind turbines is estimated for a 0.5° x 0.5° grid using a linear optimization model. For the best locations, coastal regions at the North Sea, Western Sahara and parts of Algeria, onsite hydrogen supply cost decreases from 3 €2020/kgH2 in 2030 to 2 €2020/kgH2 in 2050. The technical hydrogen supply potential is tremendous, especially from Northern Africa, and a supply to Central Europe (Germany) via pipeline for around 3 €2020/kgH2 is possible in 2050, while a domestic hydrogen production in Germany covering the projected demand would lead to cost up to 4.5 €2020/kgH2. Furthermore, a large scale hydrogen storage e.g. in salt caverns, can reduce the hydrogen supply costs for regions with high seasonality of solar and wind up to 50% and excess electricity to less than 10%, leading to fewer cost deviations between the sub-regions, resulting in lower import costs from Northern and Western Europe than from Northern Africa or Middle East. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Cryogenic liquefaction energy storage is an important form of storage for sustainable energy liquid hydrogen and other gases. The weighting parameter A in the parameter-adjusted two-phase LBM model is important for the deviation of simulation results. The aim of this paper is to discover the appropriate parameter to eliminate the deviation, and to solve the problem of large deviation between the theoretical solution and the simulated value that is caused by using different equations of state in LBM simulation. The modified PT equation of state, which is suitable for cryogenic fluids, is combined with the parameter-adjustable two-phase model to simulate the saturation density at different temperatures. Four typical cryogenic fluids—nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and helium—are exploratively simulated to find the suitable parameters to eliminate errors by analyzing the results with theoretical solutions. This is an efficient solution to the deviation between the simulated value and the theoretical solutions, which is caused by the different equation of state in LBM. The optimal A-value of the model based on the PT equation of state was obtained as −0.21, while droplets and bubbles were set into the calculation region, and an inverse relationship between the interface density gradient and temperature was analyzed. The analysis and comparison of the simulation results under the optimal value and the experimental values have laid an important foundation for the phase change simulation of the real cryogenic fluids at the mesoscopic scale. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The problem of a sudden high-pressure hydrogen jet release into a low-pressure environment is highly important in various industrial and aerospace applications that require a safe storage of pressurized hydrogen. In the present work, numerical simulations are carried out for a sudden hydrogen-jet release from a high-pressure vessel into hydrogen at atmospheric pressure through a slit. Two modeling approaches are extensively compared: 1) Full-scale solution of the entire problem, which includes the high-pressure vessel and the low-pressure hydrogen environment; 2) Simplified solution approach, which includes only the low-pressure hydrogen environment under the assumption of choked-flow conditions at the high-pressure vessel slit. It is shown in the present work that the choked-flow assumption can lead to different results from a full-scale computation. In a full-scale computation, the Mach number is subsonic at the slit exit and a "vena contracta" forms downstream of the slit exit. Both approaches are shown to capture the main flow structures, such as the lead shock, contact surface, and Mach shock. However, in the choked-slit assumption, the barrel shock is detached from the slit-exit edge and the jet expands faster than in the full-scale case. © 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Here, we identify and characterize 60 natural hydrogen seeps as analogues for potential leakage from engineered storage reservoirs to consider implications for monitoring. We report and compare the geological and environmental setting; seepage mode (dry gas/ associated with water); co-released gases; seep rates and areal fluxes; temporal variation; seep structure; gas source; and composition. Seep characteristics are determined by local geological and hydrological conditions, specifically whether hydrogen gas is seeping through soils and unconsolidated sediments, fractured bedrock or into water. Hydrogen is typically co-emitted with other gases (CO2,CH4,N2) with CH4, the most common co-emitted gas. The structural controls on seep location and characteristics are similar between hydrogen and CO2 seeps. However, compared to CO2, hydrogen is more readily dispersed when mixing with air and hydrogen is more prone to being consumed or transformed via biotic or abiotic reactions, and so the quantity of leaked hydrogen can be greatly attenuated before seeping. Monitoring approaches should therefore be tailored to the local geology and hydrological conditions, and monitoring approaches to detect hydrogen and associated gases would be appropriate. © 2023 The Author(s).},

The feasibility study was conducted in five steps. First, regarding the weather data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest wind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen production facility was modeled for all these locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis requires a considerable amount of water with specific quality and because Iran suffers from water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this regard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is treated in a desalination plant and is sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study intends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping model for the transportation of water, electricity, and ammonia from/to the production site and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using satellite images, and takes into account all pumping/compression stations required to transport these media. This study provides a realistic cost of green hydrogen/ammonia production in Iran and export, considering all related processes involved in the hydrogen supply chain. © Proceedings of ECOS 2022 - 35th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.},

	abstract = {A fixed mass perspective signifies a concept of which the mass of flammable or combustible gas is fixed but the volume and concentration could be different depending on leak conditions such as location and size of leak hole, ventilation conditions, etc. This phenomenon could make the explosion level different, even if the total amount of combustible/flammable material is the same. Nevertheless, most of related studies on the gas explosion have been conducted in a fixed volume perspective which is a concept with fixed volume and variable mass of combustible/flammable material. In this study, therefore, the blast loading analysis in the fixed mass perspective on the natural gas which is being used in the maritime transport industries and hydrogen which will be used as eco-friendly energy in the future was performed by CFD simulations. The upper deck, where the fuel storage tank could be located, and compartment, where the engine and pipe could be positioned, were selected as geometrical conditions of explosion simulations because these spaces have the relatively high possibility for leak and explosion accidents in ships.

	abstract = {As a clean energy source, hydrogen has attracted much attention due to its high thermal conversion efficiency, recyclability and non-polluting properties. Recently, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have become a global research hotspot, and the number of hydrogen refueling stations is steadily increasing. But the biggest problem holding them back is that the filling of high-pressure hydrogen causes a rapid increase in the internal temperature of the storage tank. In order to make hydrogen fuel cell vehicles fully popular, the principle of temperature rise is systematically elucidated, the influence of refueling parameters on the tank state is summarized and appropriate mitigation measures and solutions to limit or mitigate the effects of temperature rise are proposed in this review, such as pre-cooling the hydrogen in advance, reducing the initial hydrogen content in the tank and ensuring that the ambient temperature and the initial tank temperature are at a low level. In addition, a number of safe refueling strategies and methods are presented. Through the comprehensive study in this paper, the important relationship between the refueling parameters and the temperature rise in the tank is refined, which is very useful in promoting the development of new refueling strategies and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen plays an increasingly significant role in solving the greenhouse effect and energy crisis as a clean fuel that can be obtained by renewable energy, and as a storable energy carrier. As a prerequisite for process safety of hydrogen, issues such as hydrogen embrittlement, fire, and explosion, have been of great interest to research scholars for decades. Based on bibliometrics, this article aims to provide a knowledge structure of publications related to hydrogen safety. Information about 369, 535 and 462 publications related to hydrogen safety from 1957 to 2021 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and Lens, respectively. The visualization software VOSviewer was employed to carry out the bibliometric analysis. The study found that the USA has the most publications among all countries; the publications from the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy rank the first among all source journals. Based on the advancement of time period, the hot terms in hydrogen safety research can be divided into three themes: storage and detection, combustion and explosion, and ignition and propagation. The results provide a comprehensive overview of this field of research and can help researchers quickly understand the research frontier and the overall status. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {The hydrogen economy is about to shift towards a large-scale decarbonization solution, a transition in which green hydrogen will take the stage. An increasing share of green hydrogen means that supply and demand will be more widely spread, in terms of distance as well as timing. Transport system operators see a temporary role for themselves in solving this issue of imbalance. Gasunie will have developed a 'hydrogen backbone' by 2030, approximately 1200 km in length, of which 80% will consist of re-used natural gas pipelines with 36-48 inch diameters. Hydrogen pipeline networks can efficiently accommodate temporal imbalances via their linepack. However, there is a downside to using linepack this way. Highly volatile production volumes of green hydrogen, caused by volatile wind and solar profiles, will result in frequent significant pressure fluctuations in the pipelines. This is worrying because pipeline crack-like defects in contact with hydrogen gas grow about ten times faster compared to natural gas under the same pressure fluctuations. This effect is known as hydrogen-enhanced fatigue defect growth. Increasing the frequency and amplitude of pressure fluctuations for balancing using linepack will lead to even higher defect growth rates, compared to a more constant pressure regime. Enhanced fatigue can be prevented by controlling the pressure fluctuations, but this limits the maximum available linepack. This difficult choice between commercial interests and pipeline integrity justifies performing a quantitative analysis of market-driven pressure fluctuations in hydrogen networks and their effect on defect growth and lifetimes of these hydrogen networks. This paper describes an integrated simulation model that can calculate dynamic network behaviour for hydrogen transport networks and give an indication of the corresponding defect growth risks that come with this network behaviour. By using this integrated simulation model, safe margins can be calculated for providing sufficient linepack without risking increased hydrogen-enhanced fatigue defect growth, which can undermine the integrity of a pipeline and reduce the lifetime of this asset. Insights from this model are applied by Gasunie to maximize security of supply and minimize integrity risks. This is essential in the start-up phase of the hydrogen economy due to the absence of sufficient flexibility in production and storage. Copyright © 2022 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Metals and alloys are among the most technologically important materials for our industrialized societies. They are the most common structural materials used in cars, airplanes and buildings, and constitute the technological core of most electronic devices. They allow the transportation of energy over great distances and are exploited in critical parts of renewable energy technologies. Even though primary metal production industries are mature and operate optimized pyrometallurgical processes, they extensively rely on cheap and abundant carbonaceous reactants (fossil fuels, coke), require high power heating units (which are also typically powered by fossil fuels) to calcine, roast, smelt and refine, and they generate many output streams with high residual energy content. Many unit operations also generate hazardous gaseous species on top of large CO2 emissions which require gas-scrubbing and capture strategies for the future. Therefore, there are still many opportunities to lower the environmental footprint of key pyrometallurgical operations. This paper explores the possibility to use greener reactants such as bio-fuels, bio-char, hydrogen and ammonia in different pyrometallurgical units. It also identifies all recycled streams that are available (such as steel and aluminum scraps, electronic waste and Li-ion batteries) as well as the technological challenges associated with their integration in primary metal processes. A complete discussion about the alternatives to carbon-based reduction is constructed around the use of hydrogen, metallo-reduction as well as inert anode electrometallurgy. The review work is completed with an overview of the different approaches to use renewable energies and valorize residual heat in pyrometallurgical units. Finally, strategies to mitigate environmental impacts of pyrometallurgical operations such as CO2 capture utilization and storage as well as gas scrubbing technologies are detailed. This original review paper brings together for the first time all potential strategies and efforts that could be deployed in the future to decrease the environmental footprint of the pyrometallurgical industry. It is primarily intended to favour collaborative work and establish synergies between academia, the pyrometallurgical industry, decision-makers and equipment providers. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] Highlights: A more sustainable production of metals using greener reactants, green electricity or carbon capture is possible and sometimes already underway. More investments and pressure are required to hasten change. Discussion: Is there enough pressure on the aluminum and steel industries to meet the set climate targets?The greenhouse gas emissions of existing facilities can often be partly mitigated by retrofitting them with green technologies, should we close plants prematurely to build new plants using greener technologies?Since green or renewable resources presently have limited availability, in which sector should we use them to maximize their benefits? © 2022, The Author(s).},

An option that has been receiving much focus after the COVID pandemic is the development of a hydrogen economy. Challenges for a hydrogen economy are the high investment costs involved in compression, storage, and long-distance transportation. This paper analyses an innovative proposal for the creation of hydrogen ocean links. It intends to fill existing gaps in the creation of a hydrogen economy with the increase in flexibility and viability for hydrogen production, consumption, compression, storage, and transportation. The main concept behind the proposals presented in this paper consists of using the fact that the pressure in the deep sea is very high, which allows a thin and cheap HDPE tank to store and transport large amounts of pressurized hydrogen in the deep sea. This is performed by replacing seawater with pressurized hydrogen and maintaining the pressure in the pipes similar to the outside pressure.

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of techno-economic modelling for hydrogen production from a photovoltaic battery electrolyser system (PBES) for injection into a natural gas transmission line. Mellitah in Libya, connected to Gela in Italy by the Greenstream subsea gas transmission line, is selected as the location for a case study. The PBES includes photovoltaic (PV) arrays, battery, electrolyser, hydrogen compressor, and large-scale hydrogen storage to maintain constant hydrogen volume fraction in the pipeline. Two PBES configurations with different large-scale storage methods are evaluated: PBESC with compressed hydrogen stored in buried pipes, and PBESL with liquefied hydrogen stored in spherical tanks. Simulated hourly PV electricity generation is used to calculate the specific hourly capacity factor of a hypothetical PV array in Mellitah. This capacity factor is then used with different PV sizes for sizing the PBES. The levelised cost of delivered hydrogen (LCOHD) is used as the key techno-economic parameter to optimise the size of the PBES by equipment sizing. The costs of all equipment, except the PV array and batteries, are made to be a function of electrolyser size. The equipment sizes are deemed optimal if PBES meets hydrogen demand at the minimum LCOHD. The techno-economic performance of the PBES is evaluated for four scenarios of fixed and constant hydrogen volume fraction targets in the pipeline: 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. The PBES can produce up to 106 kilotonnes of hydrogen per year to meet the 20% target at an LCOHD of 3.69 €/kg for compressed hydrogen storage (PBESC) and 2.81 €/kg for liquid hydrogen storage (PBESL). Storing liquid hydrogen at large-scale is significantly cheaper than gaseous hydrogen, even with the inclusion of a significantly larger PV array that is required to supply additional electrcitiy for liquefaction. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {As climate change makes it essential for the industry to move away from fossil fuels it is important to reconceptualize the entire system of energy production and distribution. In engineering design practice we focus on creating solutions and designs that may be highly effective and efficient without taking into account evolving market structures. We hypothesize that to realize evolving market structures, engineering design needs to be policy-driven and facilitate the monetization of investment by industry, and equitable social return on investment for the government and community. There is interest in transitioning to a low carbon hydrogen economy. There is a considerable body of work on making green hydrogen production cost-effective while also creating useful forms of carbon. There is little work done, however, on modeling the storage and distribution services for at-scale hydrogen deployment and cross-disciplinary modeling of technologies and services to enable an effective transition. In essence, current translation research is limited by an underlying assumption that the only obstacle to hydrogen adoption is achieving cost competitiveness, which disregards the roles that stakeholders (government, industry, and community) may play in enabling or hindering a transition. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying policies for transitioning to a low carbon hydrogen economy from a business (market structure) perspective. This involves framing a design problem for an evolving market from a policy-driven perspective. We use the business model canvas as the foundational framework to map the activities and services required to effectively supply resources and satisfy the demand to identify gaps in provided services and potential bottlenecks in transition or integration. We demonstrate this potential by using the business model canvas to identify a way forward in transitioning to a new market structure for a low carbon hydrogen economy. Copyright © 2022 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy power plants and transport and heating electrification projects are being deployed to enable the replacement of fossil fuels as the primary energy source. This transition encourages distributed generation but makes the grid more weather-dependent, thus reducing its inertia. Simultaneously, electrical network operators face voltage, frequency, and stability challenges at the distribution level. Networks were not designed to manage the stochasticity of renewable energy sources or the congestion caused by the new transport and heating demands. Such challenges are commonly addressed through infrastructure reinforcements. This review studies how energy storage systems with different carriers can provide a collaborative solution involving prosumers as ancillary services providers at the distribution level. We focused on the European urban context; thus, we analyzed renewable energy sources, batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen fuel cells, thermal energy storage, and electric vehicles. A thorough review of successful implementations proved that including storage in one or more carriers benefits the distribution system operators and the prosumers, from both technical and economic perspectives. We propose a correlation between individual energy storage technologies and the ancillary services they can provide based on their responses to specific grid requirements. Therefore, distribution system operators can address network issues together with the prosumers. Nevertheless, attractive regulatory frameworks and business models are required to motivate prosumers to use their assets to support the grid. Further work is recommended to describe the joint operation of multiple storage technologies as multicarrier systems, focusing on the coupling of electrical and thermal energy storage. Additionally, how ancillary services affect the energy storage system’s aging should be studied. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Integrated hydrogen systems need technology to store hydrogen (H2) for many applications. Conventionally, hydrogen can be kept either in the gaseous state (under 500-700 bars) or as a liquid at cryogenic temperature (almost 20 K). Alternatively, metal hydrides (MH)-based storage of hydrogen is currently the state-of-the-art approach to storing hydrogen that offers both safety and higher storage efficiency. However, the main challenge in the MH is the low thermal conductivity that limits the heat transfer during the exothermic adsorption and endothermic desorption processes. This ultimately leads to slow reaction rates and ultimately to higher charging and discharging durations. To improve the performance of MH-based hydrogen storage systems, it is crucial to optimize the heat and mass transfer mechanisms within the MH bed. This work is an attempt to model the heat and mass transfer phenomena during the adsorption process of hydrogen. The governing equations are discretized based on Finite Volume Method and Euler’s implicit method is used for time integration. This method offers a robust and customizable numerical approach that can examine the performance of a broad range of metal hydrides and system configurations for varying environmental conditions. This will enable the modeling and optimization of heat and mass transfers, aimed at reducing the charging and discharging times of these systems. The analyzed parameters include temperature, equilibrium pressure, and average reacted fraction of hydrogen during the adsorption process. The reacted fraction profile from the inhouse developed 2D axis symmetrical model is validated with the experimental data reported in the literature. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

	abstract = {Renewables in the offshore space are integrated with technologies to deliver at-scale solutions for offshore green Hydrogen production and sustainable renewable energy. The system in the frame of the Deep Purple project consists of offshore wind turbines and offshore Hydrogen technologies for the production, storage and transportation of energy in the form of pressurized green Hydrogen. It can also be used to supply offgrid energy in remote locations, and to provide green Hydrogen for decarbonizing industrial processes. Within this context, subsea pipelines are needed to transport gaseous Hydrogen. Nevertheless, Hydrogen is well known for its ability to cause steel embrittlement and is also a non-usual gas within standard offshore Oil & Gas sector. For these reasons, caution has to be taken and suited qualification testing needs to be conducted to propose a reliable transportation solution. Flexible pipes represent an effective and versatile solution for conveying gaseous Hydrogen subsea from fixed or floating turbines or systems, in particular under dynamic conditions. Their intrinsic low allowable minimum bending radius, and tolerance to accommodate large relative motions, make this field proven solution in Oil & Gas infrastructures a perfect choice for floating offshore systems in shallow water areas targeted for deployment of offshore wind turbines with Hydrogen technologies. Furthermore, the efficient installation time and cost enable to envisage an extended use for the offshore green Hydrogen transportation systems. Finally, by construction, flexible pipes have their high strength steel wires in between two polymer sheathes, in a less severe, so-called annulus, environment. With this kind of solution, a very low part (< 1% of the flow) of the carried Hydrogen will permeate through the external polymer sheath but the high strength steels will be submitted to lowered Hydrogen pressures compared to bore, and might be used without any embrittlement risk. Within the frame of the present study, many materials used in flexible pipes for Oil & Gas application have been tested in presence of gaseous Hydrogen, in annulus (a few tens of bar) or in bore (a few hundred bar) conditions: different carbon steel grades, used as wires and connexion parts, 316L austenitic stainless steel and several polymer materials (polyethylene, thermoplastic elastomer, polyamide). It includes the following tests: Slow Strain Rate Tensile (SSRT), toughness, fatigue, crack propagation, four points bending, Rapid Gas Decompression (RGD) and ageing. Results allow to select materials compliant with the Hydrogen transport application and to acquire the data needed to perform the detailed engineering of the flexible pipe. Furthermore, they enable to establish the flexible pipe as a qualified and reliable solution for Hydrogen transportation, tolerating advantageously elevated hydrogen pressure. This work is likely one of the first to be discussing about the influence of Hydrogen on materials used in flexible pipes for subsea transportation and to highlight a qualified solution for such an Hydrogen carrier application. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {With high energy density both by weight and volume, ammonia (NH3) is a promising hydrogen carrier. Furthemore, NH3 has a mature industrial background, and in liquid form storage and transportation is not a problem. Adding the merit of zero CO2 emission, NH3-to-power by direct ammonia solid oxide fuel cells (DA-SOFCs) is an acceptable strategy to facilitate hydrogen usage. Nonetheless, to achieve efficacy, a high compatibility between operating temperature and catalytic materials for NH3 decomposition is needed. In this work, we developed a tubular DA-SOFC with an output power capability of > 3 W. By combining experimental measurements and multi-physics simulation, we comprehensively studies the related intrinsic processes. Based on experimental data, we developed a two-dimensional multi-scale electro-thermo model of tubular DA-SOFC. Separately we evaluated the effects of inlet fuel gas composition, inlet flow velocity, operating temperature, and operating voltage on the rate of NH3 catalytic decomposition and H2 electrochemical oxidation, as well as on NH3 conversion, H atom utilization, and electrical efficiency of the tubular DA-SOFC. The results suggest that high H atom utilization could be realized by matching the rate of NH3 decomposition with that of H2 electrochemical oxidation. It was observed that with the decrease of temperature, the rate of H2 oxidation decreases more rapidly than that of NH3 decomposition, suggesting that the flow velocity of NH3 should be appropriately lowered to optimize H atom utilization. Finally, we established a correlation between H atom utilization, operating voltage, and electrical efficiency for synergistic optimization of operating conditions. At 0.7 V and 800 ℃, the tubular DA-SOFC fueled with NH3 of 27 mL·min−1 is capable of offering 3.2 W, displaying an efficiency of 60%. Compared to that of a tubular H2-SOFC (only 51% efficiency), the efficiency is significantly higher on the basis of equal voltage and fuel utilization ratio. The outcome of the present study demonstrates the potential of tubular DA-SOFC as a device for high-efficiency power generation. © 2021},

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) produced using renewable energy could be used to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in industrial sectors such as steel, chemicals, transportation, and energy storage. Knowing the delivered cost of renewable H2 is essential to decision-makers looking to utilize it. The cheapest location to source it from, as well as the transport method and medium, are also crucial information. This study presents a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the delivered cost for renewable H2 for any usage location globally, as well as the most cost-effective production location and transport route from nearly 6,000 global locations. Several industrially dense locations are selected for case studies, the primary two being Cologne, Germany and Houston, United States. The minimum delivered H2 cost to Cologne is 9.4 €/kg for small scale (no pipelines considered), shipped from northern Egypt as a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC), and 7.6 €/kg piped directly as H2 gas from southern France for large scale (pipelines considered). For small-scale H2 in Houston, the minimum delivered cost is 8.6 €/kg trucked as H2 gas from the western Gulf of Mexico, and 7.6 €/kg for large-scale demand piped as H2 gas from southern California. The south-west United States and Mexico, northern Chile, the Middle East and north Africa, south-west Africa, and north-west Australia are identified as the regions with the lowest renewable H2 cost potential, with production costs ranging from 6.7—7.8 €/kg in these regions. Each is able to supply differing industrially dominant areas. Furthermore, the effect of parameters such as year of construction, electrolyser, and H2 demand is analysed. For the case studies in Houston and Cologne, the delivered H2 cost is expected to reduce to about 7.8 €/kg by 2050 in Cologne (no pipelines considered, PEM electrolyser) and 6.8 €/kg in Houston.

	abstract = {Abstract—: Among the directions of alternative energy development is the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier. At present, the worldwide production of relatively pure hydrogen by water electrolysis does not exceed 5%. Other methods of hydrogen production are accompanied by its contamination with impurities. At the same time, fuel cells and turbine-cooling systems, and engines require high-purity hydrogen. One of the promising and safe methods of hydrogen purification is based on its selective absorption during filtration through a layer of metal hydride. This article presents the results of a numerical study of heat- and mass-transfer processes in a flow-through metal hydride reactor for hydrogen purification with internal finning in the “active” volume (the volume of the sorption layer). To enhance heat transfer from the metal hydride bed to the cooled or heated reactor walls, radial fins made of various metals are used. Internal finning options and the effect of external cooling conditions on heat- and mass-transfer processes in the reactor are analyzed. The sensitivity of the simulation results to the accuracy of determining the parameters of the mathematical model is checked. It has been demonstrated that internal finning and proper selection of the external cooling conditions can considerably improve the performance of the metal-hydride system for storage and purification of hydrogen. A conclusion has been made that the density of the fins (the number of fins) and the thermal conductivity of the fin material have a noticeable effect on the efficiency of a flow reactor only when certain values of the heat-transfer coefficient to the coolant are attained on the reactor wall surface. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

	abstract = {Due to the multiple advantages of activated carbon (e.g. high specific surface area, safety and low cost) toward hydrogen storage, the subject of heat management in H2-storage tanks has become a research focus in recent years. In this work, using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (implemented in Fluent software), the performance of a hydrogen storage tank (packed with activated carbon) was analyzed in the presence of PCM/oil-based thermal recovery/release systems. The charging, dormancy, and discharging cycles of the storage tank were investigated with respect to the variation of the injected mass flow rate of hydrogen (from 2 × 10−4 to 8 × 10−4 kg/s). There was good agreement between our findings and those obtained from the experiment. It was observed that the adsorption capacity of the solid bed is proportionally enhanced with the rise in the mass flow rate of hydrogen. In addition, independently of the used hydrogen mass flow rate, it has been observed that the charging periods were ended at the same instant (i.e. t = 400 s). According to the enthalpy contours and liquid fraction of PCM (~18 and 30 % at 400 and 4000 s, respectively), it has been concluded that the thermal conductivities of the adopted PCM and that of solid bed (activated carbon) should be enhanced for better performance of the hydrogen stocking tank. Finally, from a viewpoint of storage performance and process cost, it is therefore possible to realize rapid charging/discharging of the activated carbon tank with adopting a PCM and oil-based thermal unit for heat management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Hydrogen, as an energy vector, provides viable solutions for replacing polluting and carbon-emitting fossil fuels. Gaseous hydrogen can be stored underground and coupled with existing natural gas pipe networks. Salt cavern storage is the best suited technology to meet the challenges of new energy systems. Hydrogen storage caverns are currently operated in the UK and Texas. A preliminary risk analysis dedicated to underground hydrogen salt caverns highlighted the importance of containment losses (leaks) and the formation of gas clouds following blowouts, whose ignition may generate dangerous phenomena such as jet fires, unconfined vapor cloud explosions (UVCEs), or flashfires. A blowout is not a frequent accident in gas storage caverns. A safety valve is often set at a 30 m depth below ground level; it is automatically triggered following a pressure drop at the wellhead. Nevertheless, a blowout remains to be one of the significant accidental scenarios likely to occur during hydrogen underground storage in salt caverns. In this paper, we present modelling the subterraneous and aerial parts of a blowout on an EZ53 salt cavern fully filled with hydrogen. © 2022 by the authors.},

Thermal behaviour and charging/discharging performances of this innovative arrangement were investigated by considering the impacts of the operating parameters including hydrogen pressure, hydrogen flow rates, and effective thermal conductivity of PCM. Introducing PCM for thermal management of MH offered a possibility to store the heat released during hydrogen charging mode and transfer it back to the canister during discharging. The test results suggest that the total amount of hydrogen being utilised, while MH absorption/release rates being maintained at desired levels, is improved by two times after employing PCM for its thermal management. However, the maximum accumulative amount of hydrogen absorbed/released by the MH was still only up to 26 % of its total storage capacity with hydrogen charging rate dropped gradually after being started from 1.1 slpm. Recognising the low thermally conductivity of the PCM as the root cause of this shortfall, 10 PPI copper metal foam (MF) with 96 % porosity was embedded in the PCM. By introducing this MF, the full capacity of the MH canister could be utilised at continuous charging and discharging rates of 1.1 slpm and 1.5 slpm, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper focuses on the volume change of the combustible area after double ferrule joint leaks. First, a calibrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was built and calibrated for accuracy through a hydrogen horizontal jet process. Second, the schlieren method was used to observe the hydrogen leakage morphology when the pipe was scratched. The CFD model was used to investigate the morphology and combustible volume changes under different wind directions and speeds. Third, critical wind speed (CWS), representing the disturbance wind speed when the combustible volume generated by the hydrogen jet was reduced to 85% of the non-disturbed environment, was proposed. Fourth, the scratch leakage behavior with the double ferrule joint placed horizontally was simulated. This research found that forced convection in the hydrogen system reduced the combustible volume produced by the hydrogen jet, and the typical value of CWS here was 1.5 m/s. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {Integrating metal hydride (MH) for hydrogen storage with phase change materials (PCMs) received increasing attention today to ensure effective thermal management in MH-storage reactors and reduce the operating cost of the process. This study revealed the first coupling approach (at large scale) of hydrogen storage in LaNi5 alloys with heat recovery by using a PCM loaded with nanoparticles (i.e. the MH-nano-PCM system) in a cylindrical MH-tank reactor (diameter: 1 m) equipped with four tubes of nano-PCM. Mass and heat transfer phenomena were computationally analyzed in the diverse regions of the reactor. The temporal temperature profiles (average and contours), the MH-hydrogenation efficiency, the velocity contours and PCM-liquid fraction were established in the presence (at 5% v/v) and absence of four types of nano-oxides (Al2O3, MgO, SnO2 and SiO2). Significant results were obtained. The nano-PCM system efficiently recuperates the heat lost from the exothermal absorption reaction; however, a slight reduction in the latent energy storage unit's performance is obtained compared to pure paraffin, probably due to the thermo-transfer resistant created by the nano-particles agglomeration during the melting cycle. The PCM-tube position plays a crucial role in the PCM melting rate, where the tube located above the H2-charging pipe melts more quickly than the other tubes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Environmental issues related to climate change have constantly been increasing in the last years, and global emissions must be managed wisely, adopting the most powerful and effective strategies available. Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) is claimed as a solid climate mitigation strategy for the most challenging emissions and the production of blue hydrogen. The development of an international CO2 transportation network is considered a necessary cross-cutting topic in the whole Carbon Capture and Storage sector. CO2 pipeline development is an essential aspect for the realization of most decarbonization CCS projects. Large-scale CCS projects will require the management and transport of CO2 in the presence of impurities at lower costs than traditional CO2 pipelines utilized for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Thus, the accuracy of modelling carbon dioxide in the presence of other components needs to be assessed. Corrosion prediction and control are strongly related to water content and introduces uncertainties in terms of costs and corrosion risks, especially in the presence of other components and possible cross-chemical reactions. In this work, the process and flow assurance challenges related to the design of a CO2 pipeline have been reviewed in terms of impurities, water content, and corrosion, as well as low-temperature scenarios. The main scope of this paper is to analyse the aspects that can be improved and the ones that need for further research from a thermodynamic point of view. This will help the design of a next generation of CO2 pipelines with low CAPEX (capital expenditure) and OPEX (operating expense), suitable for large-scale CCS projects and meeting the Paris Agreements. © 2022},

	abstract = {Fast heat and mass delivery with high cycling stability of the core component, hydrogen storage bed, in SDS are essential for the operation of the future tritium factory in ITER project. However, the aforementioned properties are still perplexing in large-capacity ZrCo bed, especially for that with secondary containment structure required by the actual tritium operation in the future. Herein, the performance including heating, cycling and cooling with two different size ZrCo beds (loading of ZrCo are 200 g and 2000 g respectively) were systematically studied. The experimental data shows that the maximum heating ability of the middle-size/full-scale storage bed are both about 10 °C/min, and the maximum hydrogen absorption capacity of these ZrCo beds are 44.6 L/405.5 L, respectively. Besides, hydrogen pressure and hydrogen retention during the following desorption can affect the cycling performance of the ZrCo bed. The use of transfer pump can reduce the pressure of the bed during the hydrogen desorption process (operated at 500 °C), which inhibits the disproportionation reaction of the ZrCo alloy. However, the degree of hydrogen pressure reduction in two the types of ZrCo bed are different. As a result, the cycling capacity of the middle-size bed (93.4%, lower hydrogen pressure) is higher than the full-scale bed (68.7%, higher hydrogen pressure) after 10 cycles. When the transfer pump was not used and operated at lower temperature (350 °C), the beds cannot release hydrogen completely, and partial hydrogen atoms are retained in the ZrCo alloy. The middle-size bed still maintains a hydrogen storage capacity of 94.5% after 10 cycles, while 75.9% of the hydrogen storage capacity remained for the full-scale bed. Therefore, the increase of hydrogen surplus in ZrCo alloy is helpful to improve its cycling stability. At last, the cooling performances of the beds under 10 different cooling methods were studied. Among the cooling methods, the best cooling rate was achieved by filling nitrogen in the secondary containment cavity and flowing water passing through the cooling circuit of the bed. This work will provide a crucial reference for the design and optimization of the subsequent operation technology of SDS in ITER. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage is now the “bottleneck” to realise the application of hydrogen as renewable energy. This is because most metals can reversibly absorb hydrogen. Undoubtedly, a metal hydride reactor (MHR) is the core device used in achieving the desired stable and comprehensive performance of a hydrogen storage system. This study made significant efforts to outline a design methodology and acquired an optimised large-scale MHR (> 50 kg-MHs) for various applications. It mapped and analysed the MHR research progress in the past 20 years with the aid of CiteSpace, and formed a brief scientometric review from the start. Second, the priority in various applications was concluded in a few keywords to provide assistance to priorities adopted. By means of pre-set MH categories, sketch configurations, and the input/output path of the reaction heat and filling mode, the initial outline of the MHR was sketched reasonably by comparing and referring to wide outstanding findings. The following optimisation procedure would give designers/investigators a deep understanding of complex and multidisciplinary MHR wherein absorption and desorption, and the resultant heat and mass transport, pulverisation, self-densification, and stress characteristics were tightly coupled. Subsequently, anticipative results were obtained by designing and simulating the capacity, system gravimetric capacity, system volumetric capacity, and other core dynamic indices. This paper provides a unified design policy based on excellent reported results which could serve as a roadmap for the design of practical large-scale MHRs and is expected to be satisfied with different application scenarios. © 2022},

The reactor was filled with 9 kg of La0.7Ce0.1Ca0.3Ni5, and water was considered as heat transfer fluid. The absorption characteristics were studied under different supply pressures (5–20 bar) and desorption characteristics under different inlet temperatures of heat transfer fluid (30–50 °C). An energy efficiency based on the higher heating value of hydrogen was evaluated for the developed solid-state hydrogen storage device. Further, the effect of pre-sensible heating on desorption performance and energy efficiency was analyzed. Finally, the experimental results were compared with the extensively studied LaNi5 alloy. The results showed that the alloy exhibited a constant desorption rate despite slower desorption kinetics. The energy efficiency of the developed system was found to be 76.76%. The comparison results showed that La0.7Ce0.1Ca0.3Ni5 exhibited higher storage capacity than LaNi5 after 20 cycles and approximately similar absorption and desorption rates. The desorption process without pre-sensible heating was more efficient and reduced overall desorption time by 46.5% than the desorption with pre-sensible heating.

The advantages and issues related to each method are studied and compared. This review article aims to critically evaluate the relative system performance on thermal dynamics and hydrogen transfer aspects. The evolution of different types of alloy beds, issues related to the alloy filling and the thermal augmentation systems coupled with metal hydride beds are studied carefully. The various conventional and nonconventional heat exchanger-metal hydride assemblies are here given special attention. Enhancement of heat transfer within and from/to the hydride bed by adding high-performance thermal augmentation systems without a significant reduction in alloy to storage reactor weight ratio was identified as an essential factor in reactor design. In conjunction, it is observed that the hydrogen storage technique incorporated should be compact, reliable, and inexpensive to replace existing hydrogen storage systems. Hence, studies on the gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of hydrides, reaction kinetics, and heat transfer management in storage systems must be kept integral to reach the objective. This article might help analyze the performance characteristics of the hydride reactor and the selection of various thermal augmentation techniques to design a comparatively effective metal hydride system for precise applications. © 2022},

	abstract = {Hydrogen has been identified as one of the main axes of the energy transition. Its large-scale development faces several technological barriers. This is the case for the storage method, although today there are generally three methods: high gaseous pressure storage, liquid storage and metal hydride storage. However, only the first two have achieved technological maturity, yet they present several disadvantages in terms of the calorific value used for the compression and liquefaction of hydrogen as well as from the point of view of pressure of use and social acceptance. On the other hand, metal hydride storage offers the technical possibility to operate at low pressure and ambient temperature, with a higher volumetric energy density than the other two methods. Hydrogen storage in metal hydrides is an exothermic process and its release is an endothermic reaction, hence the idea of recovering the waste heat produced by a fuel cell to provide calories to the metal hydride hydrogen reservoir to extract the hydrogen that will in turn feed the fuel cell.

	abstract = {Metal hydride is a promising alternative for hydrogen storage. A novel metal hydride reactor coupled with thermochemical heat storage material is proposed to reduce the energy loss. The hydrogen charging and discharging processes are numerically and analytically investigated in this paper. Hydrogen is stored in a compacted metal hydride disk, so the reaction characteristics under low permeability are studied. The dehydration kinetic equation has been re-established to determine the equilibrium temperature at a corresponding pressure. The reactor takes 139 min for the hydrogen charging process and takes 512.8 min for the hydrogen discharging process. The reaction characteristics are found to be affected by heat transfer and gas pressure at the permeability of 5.9×10-16m2. The analytical model is found to be only applicable to the prediction of reaction time with high permeability of hydrogen in metal hydride. The thermal management of thermochemical heat storage materials has been proven to be feasible. By increasing the hydration equilibrium temperature from 321.8 °C to 350 °C, the reaction time can be decreased to 43.1 %. By decreasing the dehydration equilibrium temperature from 300 °C to 270 °C, the reaction time can be decreased to 84.5 %. To enhance the heat transfer, meal foam is added to the thermochemical heat storage material. Adding metal foam can effectively shorten the reaction time, but will reduce the hydrogen production. A metal foam with a porosity of 0.96 will reduce the production of hydrogen by 3 %. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Storage safety, especially ensuring the gas sealability of hydrogen storage wells, needs to be carefully managed. Premium OCTG connections are used to connect casing and tubing pipes in these wells. Vallourec Research and Development department has investigated a new qualification testing protocol for hydrogen storage to properly validate connections for such application. The existing qualification standard for gas well was designed for the oil and gas industry and does not consider the specificities of hydrogen storage. The lifecycle of hydrogen storage is also expected to be different from standard gas underground storage. The approach is based on two main steps. In theory, hydrogen presents a higher capacity to leak through seals compared to methane or helium. In the first step, several gases are investigated to assess the sealability capacity of a connection with a metal-to-metal seal. Leaks detections devices by vacuum and accumulation with spectrometry were compared and assessed during this phase. For the second step, a dedicated connection test flow-chart is elaborated to consider the specific lifecycle of the hydrogen storage. The first test program involves several gas mixtures including different concentrations of hydrogen. The purpose of these tests is to determine which kind of gas mixture could be used for the future connection tests to assess 100% hydrogen gas content with the lowest representative hydrogen content to facilitate testing. It was demonstrated that the accumulation leak detection method allowed a better sensibility for the leak detection up to 10-7 mbar.L/s. The conclusion of this first phase is that up to 470 bars the metalto-metal seal behavior is the same for the different hydrogen concentration studied. In the second phase, storage lifecycle was studied. A connection test protocol was created to reflect the storage with a seasonal cycle and a daily cycle of loading and unloading when the storage well helps to cope with intermittencies of hydrogen production from renewables. This second test program was performed in full-scale in 9-5/8"47.00 ppf L80 on our latest generation of advanced premium T&C connections to assess the hydrogen sealability performance with positive results. These two test programs have demonstrated a significant improvement in the performance assessment of connections with metal-to-metal seal in these hydrogen storage wells. Large scale underground storage of hydrogen will be instrumental in global decarbonization. As hydrogen is a flammable, greenhouse gas, and more prone to leak, all the well completion and production equipment will need a specific validation. The current accepted standard used to assess connection performance is API RP 5C5, which is not fully relevant for hydrogen storage applications.  Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is a renewable energy source with various features, clean, carbon-free, high energy density, which is being recognized internationally as a “future energy.” The US, the EU, Japan, South Korea, China, and other countries or regions are gradually clarifying the development position of hydrogen. The rapid development of the hydrogen energy industry requires more hydrogenation infrastructure to meet the hydrogenation need of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Nevertheless, due to the frequent occurrence of hydrogen infrastructure accidents, their safety has become an obstacle to large-scale construction. This paper analyzed five sizes (diameters of 0.068 mm, 0.215 mm, 0.68 mm, 2.15 mm, and 6.8 mm) of hydrogen leakage in the hydrogen fueling station using Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) and HyRAM software. The results show that unignited leaks occur most frequently; leaks caused by flanges, valves, instruments, compressors, and filters occur more frequently; and the risk indicator of thermal radiation accident and structure collapse accident caused by overpressure exceeds the Chinese individual acceptable risk standard and the risk indicator of a thermal radiation accident and head impact accident caused by overpressure is below the Chinese standard. On the other hand, we simulated the consequences of hydrogen leak from the 45 MPa hydrogen storage vessels by the physic module of HyRAM and obtained the ranges of plume dispersion, jet fire, radiative heat flux, and unconfined overpressure. We suggest targeted preventive measures and safety distance to provide references for hydrogen fueling stations’ safe construction and operation. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study presents a numerical simulation of a packed bed reactor filled with activated carbon for hydrogen storage, incorporating phase change material (PCM) with various heat transfer enhancers. The simulations were performed using the Fluent ANSYS. The main goal is to explore the use of PCM as a heat manager (reactor coolant) and optimize its performance by investigating the effects of various enhancers, including nanoparticles (NP), metal foam (MF), and fins, on the melting efficiency of PCM in activated carbon beds. Outcomes showed that the hydrogen adsorption capacity of 25 mmol/g was found to be independent of the type of PCM enhancer used in the system. The results showed that the MF provided the best cooling performance of the activated carbon bed, with a surface heat flux of 2750 W/m2 and a surface heat transfer coefficient of 410 W/m2K, while fins provided the highest melting rate of the PCM. In the presence of fins, metal foam, and nanoparticles, the fusion rate of PCM has been enhanced by 64, 32, and 8%, respectively, compared to pure PCM. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of packed bed reactors for hydrogen storage and can be used to optimize the thermal performance of the system. Based on the obtained findings, it is recommended that future studies on H2 storage in solid beds should be focused on the optimization of fins, metal foams, use of other nanoparticles, integration of composite PCMs, adoption of chemically modified or nanoporous carbon beds, and possibly the employment of hybrid enhancers. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {In COP 26, the international community reaffirmed its ambitious targets to reduce carbon emission to mitigate climate change according to Paris Agreement. To achieve that target, a proper combination of energy efficiency and integration of renewables should be applied to ensure a smooth energy transition that balances the increasing demand and environmental commitments. Natural gas can work as a transition fuel between the polluting fossil fuels, and zero-emission renewables such as hydrogen. Carbon capture and sequestration is another important aspect that allows reducing already existing and future carbon emissions that arise from industrial processes. However, the storage and purification of natural gas, CO2 and H2 is still challenging and represents an overhead cost that slows down the energy transition process. This review discusses the use of “zeolitic ice” or clathrate hydrates as an environmentally benign material to help the energy transition process. Having structural topologies and properties that are identical to some zeolites and zeolitic clathrasils, those green materials showed unique properties that enable their utilization in different purposes related to the energy transition, such as gas separation, desalination, fuel cells, and others. The review especially focuses on their possible role to purify and safely store gases such as CH4, CO2, and H2, which are in the heart of energy transition. Amongst the objectives of the overview is to present different possible uses of clathrates, their benchmark against existing technologies, and the possibility to integrate them into current technologies with special focus on their application for energy storage and CCS. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Most gas hydrates on the earth are in sediments and permafrost areas, and porous media are often used industrially as additives to improve gas hydrate formation. For further understanding its exploration and exploitation under natural conditions and its application in industry, it is necessary to study the effect of porous media on hydrate formation. The results show that the stacked porous media affects the phase equilibrium of hydrate formation depending on the competition water activity and large specific surface areas, while integrated porous media, such as metal foam, can transfer the hydration heat rapidly and moderate the hydrate phase equilibrium. A supersaturated metal-organic framework is able to significantly improve gas storage performance and can be used as a new material to promote hydrate formation. However, the critical particle size should be studied further for approaching the best promotion effect. In addition, together with the kinetic accelerators, porous media has a synergistic effect on gas hydrate formation. The carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of porous media can stabilize hydrate crystals through hydrogen bonding. However, the hydroxyl radicals on the silica surface inhibit the combination of CH4 and free water, making the phase equilibrium conditions more demanding.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

Also, to discuss the recent advancements of these methods including, hydrogen production, storage, and transportation on their kinetics, cyclic behavior, toxicity, pressure, thermal response, and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, new techniques such as ball milling, ultrasonic irradiation, ultrasonication, alloying, additives, cold rolling, alloying, and plasma metal reaction have been highlighted to address those drawbacks. Furthermore, the development of modern hydrogen infrastructure (reliability, safety, and low cost) is needed to scale up hydrogen delivery.

A cylindrical MH reactor configuration comprising 48 Embedded Cooling Tubes (ECT) in a circular pattern and an outer jacket was considered to accomplish the set objectives. Two identical reactors were each filled with 3.4 kg of one of the alloys. The reactor configuration allows MH alloy to be filled in the shell space while the heat transfer fluid (HTF) could flow through the tubes and the outer jacket. A set of parametric investigations was conducted on the aforementioned alloys by varying the operational parameters. During the absorption set of the parametric study, hydrogen supply pressure was varied from 10 bar to 30 bar, and HTF temperature was varied from 15 °C to 35 °C, while during the desorption study, HTF temperature was varied from 5 °C to 25 °C. At the absorption condition of 30 bar and 25 °C, the alloys A3® and LCC1® attained absorption capacity of 1.24 wt.% and 1.38 wt.%, respectively. At this condition, LCC1® was able to generate 514.5 kJ cumulative heat output in 361 s, yielding a maximum heating rate of 3.57 kW. The parametric study revealed that the absorption behaviour of A3® was more sensitive towards changes in supply pressure as well as HTF temperature compared to LCC1®. Compared to heating performance, the cooling performance of both the alloys was lower. Based on the outcomes of the experimental study, it was suggested to utilize LCC1® for decentralized hydrogen storage cum heating applications in the temperature range of 15–35 °C. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {For more than twenty years, IFP Energies Nouvelles has been developing the thermodynamic library Carnot. While devoted to the origin of the oil and gas industry, Carnot is now focused on applications related to the new technologies of energy for an industry emphasizing decarbonization and sustainability, such as CCUS, biomass, geothermal, hydrogen, or plastic and metal recycling. Carnot contains several dozens of predictive and correlative thermodynamic models, including well-established and more recent equations of state and activity coefficient models, as well as many specific models to calculate phase properties. Carnot also contains a dozen flash algorithms making possible the computation of various types of phase equilibrium, including not only two-phase and three-phase fluid equilibria but also configurations with reactive systems and with solid phases such as hydrates, wax, asphaltene, or salts. The library Carnot has a double role: first, it is a standalone toolbox for thermodynamic research and development studies. Coupled with an optimization tool, it allows to develop new thermodynamic models and to propose specific parameterizations adapted to any context. Secondly, Carnot is used as the thermodynamic engine of commercial software, such as Carbonee, Convergee, TemisFlowe, CooresFlowe or Moldie. Through this software, several hundreds of end-users are nowadays performing their thermodynamic calculations with Carnot. It has also been directly applied to design industrial processes such as the DMXe process for CO2 capture, the ATOLâ and BioButterFlye solutions for bio-olefins production, and Futurole and BioTFuele for biofuels production. In this context, this article presents some significant realizations made with Carnot for both R&D and industrial applications, more specifically in the fields of CO2 capture and storage, flow assurance, chemistry, and geoscience. © The Author(s).},

The variations in the stress, strain, pressure, temperature, and wall thickness during the spinning processes are comprehensively examined, and the optimized processing parameters are determined based on the numerical analysis results.

A universal changing-volume model (UCVM) was proposed to simplify the model expression and improve kinetics accuracy, meanwhile a model parameter (ξ) was introduced to address the effect of working conditions on kinetics. Both crystal parameter and density were simulated after crystal geometry optimization based on First-principles calculations, and H2 absorption/desorption experiments of LaNi4.5Co0.5 were employed to verify the availability of UCVM. The experimental results indicated that UCVM owned the highest model precision among several typical models. Moreover, UCVM performed a broad adaptability for other metal hydrides, and its calculation results demonstrated a prominent agreement with the experimental data of FeTi and Mg1.95Ag0.05Ni. In general, the prediction system of UCVM can precisely forecast the kinetics process under various operation conditions, which can be further developed to some liquid-solid and gas-solid catalytic reactions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In order to achieve rapid hydrogen charging and discharging of high-density hydrogen storage alloys in metal hydride (MH) tank, it is key to optimize the design of MH tank by simulation based on a credible numerical model. Herein, a multi-physical field mathematical model coupled with kinetic equations and heat & mass transfer equations for the de-/hydrogenation of Ti0.95Zr0.05Mn0.9Cr0.9V0.2 alloy in MH tank is proposed. According to experimental kinetic curves, appropriate kinetic equations dominated by different rate control steps are chosen for simulating gas-solid reactions. With excellent match between experimental and simulated kinetic results under different pressure and temperature operating conditions, a novel numerical model is established to predict the local temperature variation during the de-/hydrogenation of Ti0.95Zr0.05Mn0.9Cr0.9V0.2 alloy in a self-designed hydrogen storage tank with high-density hydrogen storage of 55.1 g H2/L. Interestingly, further calculated results reveal that the temperature evolution can be accurately matched, which proves the reliability of the designed numerical model and favors to predict the de-/hydriding behaviors. This investigation provides an effective means for subsequent structure optimization and energy & mass transfer performance optimization of high-density hydrogen storage devices, and sheds light on the numerical simulation of heat & mass transfer for advanced energy storage applications. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Providing the heating system with coal in greenhouses causes harmful results in terms of carbon emissions. In this study, analyzes were performed to meet the electrical energy required for the heating system with a heat pump from a solar photovoltaic-hydrogen system. For floor area 25000 m2 where greenhouses the required energy is obtained directly from hydrogen without using a heat pump 3000 m2 solar panel area required. The use of a heat pump reduces energy needs but it is also not feasible for large greenhouses. For convenience, a solar photovoltaic-hydrogen-heat pump system analysis was also made for 1000 m2 floor area greenhouses and it is found that the 24 m2 solar panel area is adequate in terms of meeting energy demand. Using a solar-hydrogen-heat pump system reduces carbon emissions by 86.5 tons per 1000 m2 floor area greenhouse. Considering the hydrogen storage system becomes unfeasible. We normalized the greenhouse floor area to 1 m2 and proposed reference values for hydrogen to be produced in 1 h, storage, and PV area.

This lacuna is a critical barrier in developing efficacious hydrogen storage reactors for various applications. This article chronicles the 3-D design and optimization of three basic heat exchanger setups of solid-state hydrogen storage systems (shell and tube, spiral tube, and tubular) on critical parameters. For 5 kg LaNi5, a tubular design with small tube diameters has resulted in a shorter reaction time (120 s) for 90% saturation at 303 K and 15 bar inlet conditions; however, the reactor's gravimetric density was exceptionally high. In contrast, the reactor with three spiral tubes accomplished an exemplary reaction rate at a reasonable gravimetric density. This spiral arrangement became the base for developing a novel reactor that integrated heat pipes to reduce the sorption time.

	abstract = {Ammonia as an energy storage medium is a promising set of technologies for peak shaving due to its carbon-free nature and mature mass production and distribution technologies. In this paper, ammonia energy storage (AES) systems are reviewed and compared with several other energy storage techniques. It is shown that once optimized for commercial use, AES systems have the potential for cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Its independence of topographic or climatic resource availability makes it an ideal option for many locales that has no provisions for pumped-hydro storage or with too harsh a climate for electrochemical batteries to survive. The range of applications for AES systems covers common utility-scale storage and includes electric vehicles applications. In this review, the viability of ammonia as a hydrogen carrier is discussed in detail, especially as a thermochemical energy storage media, and as a fuel for fuel cells and internal combustion engines.

The relevant structural elements are mainly made of welded portions of steel pipes, which often interact with aggressive fluids and hostile environments. Material aging is thus accelerated and localized damage processes are promoted, harming the design safety factors. The structural health of such components can be monitored in operation, throughout their lifetime, by non-destructive testing performed by portable devices. The equipment at present available on the market permits to develop fully automated testing campaigns, overcoming the difficulties associated to large extension and difficult accessibility. The data collected on site can be transferred through virtual networks, to be evaluated and processed in order to permit the quantitative evaluations required by the optimization and the planning of repair and retrofit operations.

Since these tanks store huge amounts of the fluid among all the liquid hydrogen process facilities, there is a high risk of leakage-related accidents. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a risk assessment of liquid hydrogen leakage for a grid-type liquid hydrogen storage tank (lattice-type pressure vessel (LPV): 18 m3) that overcame the low space efficiency of the existing pressure vessel shape. Through a commercially developed three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics program, the geometry of the site, where the liquid hydrogen storage tank will be installed, was obtained and simulations of the leakage scenarios for each sit-uation were performed. From the computational flow analysis results, the pool formation behavior in the event of liquid hydrogen leakage was identified, and the resulting damage range was predicted. © 2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

	abstract = {Phase change materials (PCMs) have recently been coupled with metal hydride storage tanks (MHSTs) to store adsorption heat and subsequently deliver it for hydrogen desorption through melting and solidification cycles. This method might reduce process costs by eliminating the use of HTF (i.e. heat transfer fluid). However, thermodynamics and kinetic data are scarce for large-scale MH-PCM applications, particularly when PCM is loaded in metal foams (MFs) to promote heat transfer. The current work aimed to develop a 2D model for simulating H2-absorption in a LaNi5-metal bed integrating a PCM-MF unit in a large-scale tube-and-shell heat exchanger. The constructed model (via Fluent 15.0 CFD-platform) was first-validated using referenced experimental data. The resulting heat transfer was analyzed for different MFs [aluminum, copper, nickel and titanium] of different porosities (0.1–1.0). Excellent outcomes were retrieved. By trapping the H2-absorption heat, the MF-PCM unit improved the LaNi5 hydriding. The LaNi5 charging was achieved after ∼500 s, independently of the MF type and porosity. The PCM melting rate depends on tube position, porosity and the MF type. It increased with MFs incorporation (order of enhancement: Cu > Al > Ni > Ti) and MF-porosity decrease (from ε = 100% to 10%). Besides, the PCM tube above the H2-feeding pipe melts more quickly than the other tubes, presumably to the gravitational-force effect. Longer times (i.e. 9 000 s to >16 000 s, depending on tube position) were recorded for complete melting of the PCM when εMF = 100%; however, when εMF is less than 80%, the required time for total melting was tremendously reduced to less than 500 s. Nevertheless, the MFs porosity could not be decreased considerably to avoid a huge loss of material storage (PCM), thereby diminishing the thermal storage performance of the PCM matrix. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {An optimal hydrogen storage reactor should have a higher chemical reaction rate by which the heat can be exchanged as fast as possible. The configuration of heat exchanger structure design plays a crucial role in improving heat and mass transfer effect in metal hydride beds. Consequently, a variety of different metal hydride bed configurations have been investigated in experimental and simulation works for the improvement of absorption/desorption rate. In this work, the development of metal hydride bed design in recent decades has been reviewed to help the readers summarize and optimize the reactor configuration. The summarization and review of metal hydrides design can be broadly classified into five distinct categories, which are: 1) design of cooling tubes, 2) design of fins, 3) increasing and arrangement of cooling tubes, 4) other geometric design, and 5) utilization of phase change material. This work is concentrated on assessing the heat and mass transfer effectiveness of various reactor structure configurations. The superiority and weakness of different configurations are summarized to give a comparison of the heat exchange effects. Moreover, the structural parameter analysis for each configuration is also reviewed from the heat and mass transfer aspect. Finally, some recommendations are provided for future metal hydride bed structural designs. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The effective thermal conductivity of the rGO/Mg nanocomposite packed bed was measured by using guarded hot-plate method under various atmospheric conditions (i.e., vacuum, Ar and He). A microstructure-aware mesoscopic modeling revealed that anisotropy of the effective thermal conductivity of individual rGO/Mg nanocomposites plays an important role in determining the effective thermal conductivity of their packed bed. The validated mesoscopic model also disclosed a nontrivial interplay between the intrinsic rGO properties and the extrinsic composite structural features.

The proposed method adopts hydrogen enhanced plasticity-based mechanism in a fracture strain model to describe hydrogen embrittlement. Fracture toughness degradation of three commercial steels SA372J70, AISI4130 and X80 in high pressure hydrogen environment were investigated. Firstly, governing equations for hydrogen distribution and material damage evolution was established. Hydrogen enhanced localized flow softening effect was coupled within fracture strain dependency on stress triaxiality. Then, the numerical implementation and identification process of model parameters was described. Model parameters of the investigated steels were determined based on experiment results from literatures. Finally, with the calibrated model, fracture toughness reduction of the steels was predicted in a wide range of hydrogen pressure. The prediction results were compared with experimental results. Reasonable accuracy was reached. The proposed method is an attempt to reach balance between physical accurate prediction and engineering practicality.

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage performance for metal hydride (MH) reactor is restricted by the poor thermal conductivity of MH. In this study, the gradient porosity metal foam was added into MH reactor for enhancing heat transportation (GMF reactor), and its hydrogen absorption performance was investigated numerically in detail. Then, thermal resistance analysis was conducted to analyze the heat transportation in GMF reactor, and Genetic Algorithm was applied for optimizing metal foam distribution under different conditions. It was indicated that the hydrogenation performance for optimized two-layer GMF reactor was increased by 11.5% compared with uniform metal foam reactor (UMF reactor). The optimization results indicated that the optimal volumetric fractions of metal foam (VFMF) are about 0.08 for both optimized GMF reactor and UMF reactor with the trade-off of hydrogen storage capacity and hydrogen absorption rate. Then, a new indicator of comprehensive hydrogen storage performance (CHSP) for MH reactor was proposed, which includes the influence of hydrogen storage rate, hydrogen storage capacity, volumetric storage density and gravimetric storage density. Besides, the hydrogenation performance for optimized GMF reactor was improved with metal foam layer increasing, and the optimal porosity distribution was gradually approaching a specific power exponent trend. It was showed that the hydrogenation performance for power-exponent GMF reactor was increased by 2.8% and 18.2% compared with that of optimized four-layer GMF reactor and UMF reactor, respectively. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {For the object of reducing heat consumption in hydrogen metal hydride (MH) storage units during the discharging cycle, the nano-PCM (i.e. phase change material containing nano-oxides) strategy is adopted herein for accelerating the release of the latent heat (LH) stocked in the PCM to the MH. The process was assessed in a large-scale horizontal cylindrical reactor equipped with 4 PCM tubes distributed homogenously in the MH-bed. Mass and heat transfer were computationally analyzed in the diverse regions of the MH-nano-PCM system using a 2D numerical model developed with Fluent 15.0 CFD-software. Temporal temperature profiles (average and contours), MH-dehydrogenation efficiency, velocity contours and PCMs solidification rate were established in the presence (5% v/v) and absence of four types of nano-oxides (Al2O3, MgO, SnO2 and SiO2). Remarkable results were obtained. The nano-PCM system participated in the MH-discharging by providing latent heat (LH) and changing its physical phase. The MH was completely discharged within 700 s. Nano-oxides additions improved the solidification rate of the PCM (i.e. accelerating the release of the LH) by more 50%, with a strong dependency on the PCM-tubes position. The PCM-tube above the H2-charging pipe solidifies more quickly than the other tubes, probably to the gravitational effect. The outcomes of this research provide insight into the use of nano-PCMs as a thermal supplier in MH storage systems during the discharging cycle. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The energy sector is nowadays facing new challenges, mainly in the form of a massive shifting towards renewable energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels and a diffusion of the distributed generation paradigm, which involves the application of small-scale energy generation systems. In this scenario, systems adopting one or more renewable energy sources and capable of producing several forms of energy along with some useful substances, such as fresh water and hydrogen, are a particularly interesting solution. A hybrid polygeneration system based on renewable energy sources can overcome operation problems regarding energy systems where only one energy source is used (solar, wind, biomass) and allows one to use an all-in-one integrated systems in order to match the different loads of a utility. From the point of view of scientific literature, medium- and large-scale systems are the most investigated; nevertheless, more and more attention has also started to be given to small-scale layouts and applications. The growing diffusion of distributed generation applications along with the interest in multipurpose energy systems based on renewables and capable of matching different energy demands create the necessity of developing an overview on the topic of small-scale hybrid and polygeneration systems. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the technology, operation, performance, and economical aspects of hybrid and polygeneration renewable energy systems in small-scale applications. In particular, the review presents the technologies used for energy generation from renewables and the ones that may be adopted for energy storage. A significant focus is also given to the adoption of renewable energy sources in hybrid and polygeneration systems, designs/modeling approaches and tools, and main methodologies of assessment. The review shows that investigations on the proposed topic have significant potential for expansion from the point of view of system configuration, hybridization, and applications. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the adoption of liquid hydrogen (LH2) in industrial and transport applications is becoming increasingly widespread. The high volumetric energy density of LH2 compared to gaseous or compressed hydrogen allows for efficient storage of the fuel. In particular, LH2 is gaining success in the maritime sector because it allows to reduce carbon emissions with respect to fossil fuels and increase the quantity of hydrogen stocked on board. However, the implementation of such emerging technology is still an open issue in terms of safety. Actually, LH2 shares many of the characteristics of liquified natural gas (LNG), both with respect to chemical and physical properties, and to loss of containment scenarios. Therefore, as there is historical evidence of localized explosions (e.g., rapid phase transition (RPT)) in the case of LNG spills on water, the occurrence of severe consequences when LH2 is released onto water must be investigated. In this respect, several large-scale experiments have been performed to analyse the potential consequences of accidental releases of LH2 in or over water. Specifically, more than 80 single spill events have been carried out at release rates of approximately 0.25 kg/s, 0.50 kg/s, and 0.80 kg/s either above or below the water surface with different orientations. The results showed that the RPT phenomenon was not observed. However, the ignition of the released gas cloud with a blast wave overpressure and heat radiation to the surrounding environment was detected. The unexpected ignition of the flammable cloud is not a well-understood event. Few theories have been proposed to explain the reason behind this phenomenon, but, to date, uncertainty is still present. Based on these considerations, in the present paper, the data collected from the experimental campaign have been considered to investigate the relevance of the outcomes in view of their possible use in real applications. A comparison between the experimental set-up and operating conditions with specific industrial applications has been carried out in order to identify potential lessons learned. Overall, the present study will help laying the foundations for a safe implementation of LH2 infrastructure in the foreseeable future. © 2023 IChemE.},

In this study, the phase change material (PCM) is integrated with the tank to enhance heat transfer and recycle the reaction heat. A novel storage tank with a simple concentric straight-tube heat exchanger surrounded by PCM is put forward to improve the hydrogen storage performance. A numerical model is built to track the transfer and reaction process. By comparison, the new tank shows better heat transfer and storage performance, and the hydrogen absorption time is shortened by 60.2% than that of the tank without PCM. For the new tank, the optimal amount of PCM is obtained, based on which the increased absorption pressure could effectively accelerate the heat discharge and reaction rate during the absorption process. However, the increased inlet velocity of HTF has a limited improvement effect on heat transfer and reaction performance. Furthermore, on the PCM side of the tank, the addition of fins and increasing the thermal conductivity of PCM had little effect on the performance of the tank. © 2022},

	abstract = {The successful and fast start-up of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) at subfreezing temperatures (cold start) is very important for the use of PEMFCs as energy sources for automotive applications. The effective thermal management of PEMFCs is of major importance. When hydrogen is stored in hydride-forming intermetallics, significant amounts of heat are released due to the exothermic nature of the reaction. This excess of heat can potentially be used for PEMFC thermal management and to accelerate the cold start. In the current work, this possibility is extensively studied. Three hydride-forming intermetallics are introduced and their hydrogenation behavior is evaluated. In addition, five thermal management scenarios of the metal hydride beds are studied in order to enhance the kinetics of the hydrogenation. The optimum combination of the intermetallic, hydrogenation behavior, weight and complexity of the thermal management system was chosen for the study of thermal coupling with the PEMFCs. A 1D GT-SUITE model was built to stimulate the thermal coupling of a 100 kW fuel cell stack with the metal hydride. The results show that the use of the heat from the metal hydride system was able to reduce the cold start by up to 8.2%. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen plays a crucial role towards the decarbonization of the transport sector, whilst most of the challenges for a widespread diffusion of hydrogen-based technologies are related to storage technologies. The use of Metal Hydrides (MH) has been widely recognized as a potential solution thanks to their advantages in terms of high degree of safety, high volumetric storage density, comparatively low operating pressure, the possibility of operation at room temperature and relatively low cost. Since the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of MH are respectively highly exothermic and endothermic reactions, thermal management of the storage tank is one of the most critical issues to ensure safe and effective operations. The integration of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in the MH tank design is a potential solution for the self-contained thermal management of MH-based hydrogen storage systems, aiming at substantial charge/discharge performance improvements and ease of integration with the other hydrogen system sub-components. Although several simulation-based studies have been recently proposed about the integration of MH and PCM storage systems, most of them typically include engineering-grade assumptions that oversimplifies the thermo-chemical and thermo-physical phenomena occurring within the MH and PCM domains. Typical examples include: the thermal equilibrium assumption within the heterogeneous (gas + metal alloy) MH bed; neglecting buoyancy-driven convection during the PCM melting phase; neglecting the variation of PCM thermophysical properties with temperature and between phases. The current work aims to propose an improvement in the numerical simulation framework for a better dissection of the physical phenomena occurring while integrating PCM and MH technologies and their effects towards transport-oriented advanced designs. More specifically, User Defined Functions (UDFs) have been implemented within the state-of-the-art ANSYS® Fluent commercial CFD package in order to model thermochemistry and heat transfer within the MH bed and to efficiently couple its operation with a PCM-based thermal buffer. In this initial development stage, the study has been oriented towards the analysis of a full set of parameters related to the thermal buffer configuration, including: buoyancy (i. e. natural convection) characteristics with respect to the optimal temperature difference design, PCM thermophysical properties, geometry of the containment volumes and heat transfer surfaces. Results show that including parameters such as buoyancy is crucial for a comprehensive performance evaluation of the MH/PCM storage system, especially during MH charging/PCM heating.  © 2022 SAE International.

The model was firstly validated by comparing its results to specific experimental data. Mass and heat transfer processes inside the fixed bed were investigated for various pressures and thermochemical characteristics of the MH (thermal conductivity, porosity and reaction parameters). The findings were reported as average, local and spatial changes in the metal's bed temperature and hydrogen content. During the initial stage of the endothermic desorption (t<100 s), the bed temperature dropped dramatically in all cases . During this time, there was a massive emission of hydrogen. The bed temperature was then raised due to the reactor's external convective heating, while the hydrogen release continued until the MH was completely dehydrided. The dehydrogenation rate of the MH was enhanced when the discharge pressure was raised. Furthermore, some other characteristics of the MH, i.e., porosity, thermal conductivity, desorption rate constant and activation energy, significantly impacted the resulting mass and heat fluxes inside the bed material. © 2022},

An energy transition away from fossil fuels seems inevitable, and energy sources such as renewables and hydrogen may provide a low carbon alternative for the future energy system, particularly in large emitting nations such as the United States. This research quantifies and maps potential hydrogen fuel distribution pathways for the continental US, reflecting technological changes, barriers to deployment, and end-use-cases from 2020 to 2100, clarifying the potential role of hydrogen in the US energy transition. The methodology consists of two parts, a linear optimization of the global energy system constrained by carbon reduction targets and system cost, followed by a projection of hydrogen infrastructure development. Key findings include the emergence of trade pattern diversification, with a greater variety of end-uses associated with imported fuels and greater annual hydrogen consumption over time. Further, sensitivity analysis identified the influence of complementary technologies including nuclear power and carbon capture and storage technologies. We conclude that hydrogen penetration into the US energy system is economically viable and can contribute toward achieving Paris Agreement and more aggressive carbon reduction targets in the future. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {In this paper, the dynamic and static characterization of commercial metal hydride tanks is developed based on black box modelling. The objective is to determine the thermodynamic parameters of the hydride, such as enthalpy and entropy, and then to perform an energy management of this hydrogen storage system coupled to a fuel cell generator. Therefore, for this study, a specific test bench was developed around two hydride tanks. The hydrogen temperature and pressure were measured as a function of time and used to evaluate the thermal energy produced and consumed, as well as the amount of hydrogen, stored and released, during the absorption and desorption process respectively. The analysis of the results allowed the determination of a number of parameters such as the maximum reversible hydrogen storage capacity, which was 100 [g] for each tank with a relative capacity of 0.8 [%], the equilibrium pressure between 1 and 4 [bar] for both processes (absorption/desorption) as well as the evaluation of the hysteresis. The black-box approach makes this characterization method suitable for any solid-state hydrogen storage system, regardless of metal hydride type, geometrical shape, and tank size. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Thermal comfort is of great significance to maintain the normal metabolism of life. Personal thermal management (PTM) that passively regulates the immediate environment around the human body is a promising alternative. In this work, we report a state-of-the-art concept of self-healing inorganic hydrated salt gels (IHSGs) constructed by ionic crosslinking, covalent crosslinking and hydrogen bond crosslinking for wearable PTM. Sodium sulfate decahydrate (SSD) is selected as the energy storage medium on account of its phase change temperature near the human body temperature. The calcium alginate and the sodium polyacrylate construct the double gel network to anchor the SSD. The dynamic hydrogen bond and the dynamic ionic bond enable the self-healing feature of the SSD IHSGs. The proposed SSD IHSGs with 4% borax, 0.1% sodium hexametaphosphate and 8% sodium polyacrylate demonstrate suppressed phase separation, eliminated supercooling, highly form-stability, high instinct thermal conductivity (0.80 Wm-1K−1), high energy storage capacity (147.14 Jg−1), high self-healing rate (94.3%) and highly cost-effectiveness (energy storage cost 2.44 × 10-3 ¥J−1). Taking advantages of the above merits, the IHSGs are applied in wearable PTM in the static and dynamic modes to meet the thermal comfort requirements. It is anticipated that the one-stop IHSG solution offers great prospect for the advanced wearable PTM. © 2022},

	abstract = {As the world is keen on cleaner and sustainable energy, hydrogen energy has the potential to be part of the green energy transition to replace fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. However, hydrogen energy storage is a difficult task since physical storage in the form of compressed gas under high pressure is associated with safety issues. Another form of hydrogen storage is material-based storage, which is the safest way to store hydrogen energy in a particulate matter, known as metal hydrides. Metal hydrides can store hydrogen at room temperature and use less volume to store the same amount of hydrogen compared to classical gas tanks. The challenges with the metal hydrides reactor are their slow charging process and the requirement of proper thermal management during the charging process. In this study, a metal hydride reactor model is developed in COMSOL Multiphysics, and the associated heat transfer simulations are performed. The main objective of this research is to optimize the cooling channel design in the metal hydride reactor, where the R-134a coolant rejects heat through both latent and sensible heat transfer. The study showed that the phase-changing coolant and varying convection coefficient along the length of tubes significantly reduce the hydrogen charging time and the peak temperature of the reactor during hydrogen absorption. The pumping power analysis for the R-134a flow was also conducted. The computation results reveal that coolant channel configurations with nine or more tube-passes require significantly large pumping power. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Mg-based hydrides have gained formidable interest for hydrogen storage applications due to their high intrinsic hydrogen capacity up to 7.6 wt%. However, their ability to absorb/desorb hydrogen is limited by their slow inherent kinetics and the heat and mass transfer within the storage container. The dehydrogenation of the metal hydride material in the container becomes important when coupling with a fuel cell, since the fuel cell requires a constant H2 flow rate to provide constant power output. In this study, we investigate numerically the dehydrogenation performance of a cylindrical container filled with 300 g of ball milled Mg90Ti10 + 5 wt% C with the objective to identify the operating conditions at which the H2 flow rate is higher or equal to the threshold for a proper functioning of a fuel cell. The heat exchange in the container is improved by a combination of internal basin-like and external annular fins. The heat transfer characteristics used in the numerical model are determined from the experimental work conducted in our laboratory. The results show that during the dehydrogenation process, at low convective heat transfer coefficient of 5–35 W/m2 K, the hydride container can supply H2 to a fuel cell with different power rating from 100 to 250 W for a long period of time with nearly constant flow rate. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Numerical modelling and study of metal hydride bed with heat and mass transfer is a key to identify and predict the state of the storage device during absorption and desorption process. It is a great challenge to numerically study this problem considering cracks and volumetric expansion for conventional approaches due their limitations in treating discontinuities and large deformations. To effectively predict the hydrogen charging performance with the influences of cracks and volumetric expansion, a novel peridynamic (PD) model considering hydrogen absorption was proposed, which has not been used in most existing studies. The developed PD model was applied to simulate metal hydride reaction including depleted uranium (DU) and zirconium cobalt (ZrCo) in a thin-layer bed. The simulation results agreed well with both existing numerical solutions and experimental observations. The cracks were introduced to identify their influences on the performance of hydrogen absorption in a DU bed as a prototype. It is demonstrated that crack length and location had a significant influence on the absorption rate and average temperature evolution. With the increase in the crack length, the hydrogen absorption efficiency of the metal hydride bed (MHB) decreases dramatically due to the high bed temperature. The crack approaching the cooling boundary would greatly affect the temperature evolution, which causes the average H/M value to reach saturation later. Finally, the effects of the volumetric expansion were taken into consideration in the present PD model. Unlike ZrCo, the hydrogen kinetics performance would be overrated due to the neglection of the volumetric expansion in a DU bed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

To study stratification and settlement characteristics of slush hydrogen in cryogenic tanks, a transient model based on Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluid method was developed and was verified by experiment data. Many numerical simulations were conducted to determine the influence of settlement, including particle diameter (dp = 0.5–0.015 mm), initial volume fraction of solid hydrogen (αs = 30%–50%), and heat leakage of cryogenic tank (qleak = 15–45 W m−2). It was found that there is a critical particle diameter for settlement of slush hydrogen, which is about 0.02 mm. Meanwhile, a large range of natural convection circulation has been observed in the entire tank.

The paper first condenses available literature data from modelling and experimental activities, and then analyses a basic numerical benchmark of a low-temperature MH-PCM system. Findings from the literature review show that, due to the interrelation between efficient thermal management and hydrogen desorption rate, the selected performance indicators are not independent one from another. It is also confirmed that simultaneously achieving high-power (flexibility) and specific capacity (compactness) is a challenging goal for such kind of hydrogen storage systems. The parametric analysis of the numerical benchmark system suggests that, for a given MH operating pressure-temperature envelope, special care should be given in the PCM accurate characterisation and selection, as well as in the quantification of the optimal trade-off between the PCM volume and desorption kinetics performance. Furthermore it is found that the geometrical distribution of the MH and PCM volumes have a larger than expected impact on the specific discharge power. © (2023) by ECOS 2023 All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The transition to net-zero emission energy systems creates synergistic opportunities across sectors. For example, fuel hydrogen production from water electrolysis generates by-product oxygen that could be used to reduce the cost of carbon capture and storage (CCS) essential in the decarbonization of clinker production in cement making. To assess this opportunity, a techno-economic assessment was carried out for the production of clinker using oxy-combustion in a natural gas-fueled plant coupled to CCS. Material and energy flows were assessed in a reference case for clinker production (oxygen from air, no CCS), and compared to oxy-combustion clinker production from either an air separation unit (ASU, 95% O2), or water electrolysis (100% O2), both coupled to CCS. Compared to the reference, air-combusted clinker plant, oxy-combustion increases thermal energy demand by 7% and electricity demand by 137% for ASU and 67% for electrolytic oxygen. The levelized cost of oxygen supply ranges from $49/tO2 for an on-site ASU to pipelined electrolytic O2 at $35/tO2 (200 km) or $13/t O2 (20 km). The cost of clinker for the reference plant without CCS increases linearly from $84/t clinker to $193/t clinker at a carbon price of $0/tCO2 to $150/tCO2, respectively. With oxy-combustion and CCS, the clinker production cost ranges from $119 to $122/t clinker, reflecting a breakeven carbon price of $39 to $53/tCO2 compared to the reference case. The lower cost for the electrolytic supply of by-product oxygen compared to ASU oxygen must be balanced against the reliability of supply, the pipeline transport distance and the charges that may be added by the hydrogen producer. © 2022 The Authors},

For the latter, the existing pipeline network is intended to be utilized for moving a mixture of hydrogen with natural gases from clean hydrogen production centers to consumers. Understanding the coupling of fluid-structure interaction with thermodynamics of the mixtures is imperative to assure more reliable and fail-safe operations of the infrastructure for production and transportation. In this short survey, a phenomenological fracture model along with coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian/Fluid-Structure interaction model is reviewed. It is shown that the obtained simulation results are in good agreement with experimental tests at laboratory scale and full-scale settings.

	abstract = {A 2-D numerical simulation model was established based on a small-sized metal hydride storage tank, and the model was validated by the existing experiments. An external cooling bath was equipped to simulate the heating effects of hydrogen absorption reactions. Furthermore, both the type and the flow rate of the cooling fluids in the cooling bath were altered, so that changes in temperature and hydrogen storage capacity in the hydrogen storage model could be analyzed. It is demonstrated that the reaction rate in the center of the hydrogen storage tank gradually becomes lower than that at the wall surface. When the flow rate of the fluid is small, significant differences can be found in the cooling liquid temperature at the inlet and the outlet cooling bath. In areas adjacent to its inlet, the reaction rate is higher than that at the outlet, and a better cooling effect is produced by water. As the flow rate increases, the total time consumed by hydrogen adsorption reaction is gradually reduced to a constant value. At the same flow rate, the wall surface of the tank shows a reaction rate insignificantly different from that in its center, provided that cooling water or oil coolant is replaced with air. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is emerging as one of the most promising energy carriers for a decarbonised global energy system. Transportation and storage of hydrogen are critical to its large-scale adoption and to these ends liquid hydrogen is being widely considered. The liquefaction and storage processes must, however, be both safe and efficient for liquid hydrogen to be viable as an energy carrier. Identifying the most promising liquefaction processes and associated transport and storage technologies is therefore crucial; these need to be considered in terms of a range of interconnected parameters ranging from energy consumption and appropriate materials usage to considerations of unique liquid-hydrogen physics (in the form of ortho-para hydrogen conversion) and boil-off gas handling. This study presents the current state of liquid hydrogen technology across the entire value chain whilst detailing both the relevant underpinning science (e.g. the quantum behaviour of hydrogen at cryogenic temperatures) and current liquefaction process routes including relevant unit operation design and efficiency. Cognisant of the challenges associated with a projected hydrogen liquefaction plant capacity scale-up from the current 32 tonnes per day to greater than 100 tonnes per day to meet projected hydrogen demand, this study also reflects on the next-generation of liquid-hydrogen technologies and the scientific research and development priorities needed to enable them. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Especially, Europe and North African have privileged role in energy cooperation sharing a woven and complex set of natural resources, knowledge, infrastructure, clear goals towards sustainable development. Developing common projects about hydrogen can mutually help both Europe and North Africa to achieve more sustainable, reliable and modern energy systems. This paper simulates the Greenstream gas corridor (connecting Libya to Italy) under increasing hydrogen blending scenarios using a transient and multi-component fluid-dynamic model of the gas transmission system. The additional compression energy required and the compressors’ operating hours are evaluated under the hypothesis that the energy content of the transported gas is maintained. The hydrogen profiles needed to generate the blends are obtained and used to optimally size a photovoltaic-powered electrolysis system, minimizing the compressed hydrogen storage. The results indicate that the additional energy costs of transporting hydrogen blends are up to 32.5% higher than natural gas transport, while negligibly impacting the overall efficiency of energy transport. The mismatch between solar hydrogen production and pipeline receiving potential highlights a challenge to be tackled to boost intersectoral integration. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Power-to-Gas technologies could play an important role in future energy systems, since they make it possible to store surplus electric energy from fluctuating renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. In Power-to-Gas concepts, the first step towards storage is the production of H2 by electrolysis, a possible further step is methanation. The Engler-Bunte-Institute, Fuel Technology at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is conducting research on catalytic methanation in slurry bubble column reactors, which represent a highly load flexible reactor technology. To obtain experimental data at a semi-industrial scale a methanation pilot plant was built and commissioned. The plant is equipped with various safety valves, which may release the hazardous gases H2, CO and CH4 in the chemical reactor into the environment in the unintended case of overpressure, which may lead to a flammable and/or toxic cloud, threatening the safety of the workers and other humans near the plant. In this work, the safety evaluation of the accidental release in the methanation plant is performed using the numerical tool GASFLOW-MPI. Both toxicity and flammability of the hazardous gas cloud are analyzed and discussed. A local-global two-step simulation strategy, including a local computational model and a global computational model, is employed to calculate the hazardous gas dispersion efficiently and accurately. In the first step, a local detailed computational model with fine mesh is used to calculate the release mass flow through the exhaust tube and the complicated shock waves directly without any further assumption model such as the notional nozzle model. In the second step, a large-scale model with the relatively coarse mesh is chosen to efficiently predict the hazardous gas dispersion around the entire methanation plant. Moreover, the performances of two different types of exhaust pipes are compared and discussed, and the recommended exhaust pipe design is provided. The simulation results show that version B of the exhaust tubes is more recommendable from the viewpoint of safety. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Over the past years, hydrogen has been identified as the most promising carrier of clean energy. In a world that aims to replace fossil fuels to mitigate greenhouse emissions and address other environmental concerns, hydrogen generation technologies have become a main player in the energy mix. Since hydrogen is the main working medium in fuel cells and hydrogen-based energy storage systems, integrating these systems with other renewable energy systems is becoming very feasible. For example, the coupling of wind or solar systems hydrogen fuel cells as secondary energy sources is proven to enhance grid stability and secure the reliable energy supply for all times. The current demand for clean energy is unprecedented, and it seems that hydrogen can meet such demand only when produced and stored in large quantities. This paper presents an overview of the main hydrogen production and storage technologies, along with their challenges. They are presented to help identify technologies that have sufficient potential for large-scale energy applications that rely on hydrogen. Producing hydrogen from water and fossil fuels and storing it in underground formations are the best large-scale production and storage technologies. However, the local conditions of a specific region play a key role in determining the most suited production and storage methods, and there might be a need to combine multiple strategies together to allow a significant large-scale production and storage of hydrogen. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Liquid manure (slurry) from livestock releases methane (CH4) that contributes significantly to global warming. Existing models for slurry CH4 production—used for mitigation and inventories—include effects of organic matter loading, temperature, and retention time but cannot predict important effects of management, or adequately capture essential temperature-driven dynamics. Here we present a new model that includes multiple methanogenic groups whose relative abundance shifts in response to changes in temperature or other environmental conditions. By default, the temperature responses of five groups correspond to those of four methanogenic species and one uncultured methanogen, although any number of groups could be defined. We argue that this simple mechanistic approach is able to describe both short- and long-term responses to temperature where other existing approaches fall short. The model is available in the open-source R package ABM (https://github.com/sashahafner/ABM) as a single flexible function that can include effects of slurry management (e.g., removal frequency and treatment methods) and changes in environmental conditions over time. Model simulations suggest that the reduction of CH4 emission by frequent emptying of slurry pits is due to washout of active methanogens. Application of the model to represent a full-scale slurry storage tank showed it can reproduce important trends, including a delayed response to temperature changes. However, the magnitude of predicted emission is uncertain, primarily as a result of sensitivity to the hydrolysis rate constant, due to a wide range in reported values. Results indicated that with additional work—particularly on the magnitude of hydrolysis rate—the model could be a tool for estimation of CH4 emissions for inventories. Copyright: © 2021 Dalby et al.

	abstract = {The review presented herein is regarding the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) phenomena of carbon steel pipelines affected by the corrosive electrolytes that comes from external (E) and internal (I) environments, as well as the susceptibility and tensile stress on the SCC. Some useful tools are presented including essential aspects for determining and describing the E-SCC and I-SCC in oil and gas pipelines. Therefore, this study aims to present a comprehensive and critical review of a brief experimental summary, and a comparison of physicochemical, mechanical, and electrochemical data affecting external and internal SCC in carbon steel pipelines exposed to corrosive media have been conducted. The SCC, hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC), hydrogen embrittlement, and sulfide stress cracking (SSC) are attributed to the pH, and to hydrogen becoming more corrosive by combining external and internal sources promoting cracking, such as sulfide compounds, acidic soils, acidic atmospheric compounds, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, organic acids (acetic acid, mainly), bacteria induced corrosion, cathodic polarization, among others. SCC growth is a reaction between the microstructural, chemical, and mechanical effects and it depends on the external and internal environmental sources promoting unpredictable cracks and fractures. In some cases, E-SCC could be initiated by hydrogen that comes from the over-voltage during the cathodic protection processes. I-SCC could be activated by over-operating pressure and temperature at flowing media during the production, gathering, storage and transportation of wet hydrocarbons through pipelines. The mechanical properties related to I-SCC were higher in comparison with those reviewed by E-SCC, suggesting that pipelines suffer more susceptibility to I-SCC. When a pipeline is designed, the internal fluid being transported (changes of environments) and the external environment concerning SCC should be considered. This review offers a good starting point for newcomers into the field, it is written as a tutorial, and covers a large number of basic standards in the area. © 2020, MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

The storage of hydrogen using metal hydrides shows great promise due to the ability to store and deliver energy on demand while achieving higher volumetric density and safer storage conditions compared with traditional storage options such as compressed gas or liquid hydrogen. Research is typically performed on lab-sized samples and tanks and shows great potential for large scale applications. However, the effects of scale-up on the metal hydride’s performance are relatively less investigated. Studies performed so far on both materials, and hydride-based storage tanks show that the scale-up can significantly impact the system’s capacity, kinetics, and sorption properties.

Thermal coupling of MH canisters with PEMFC offers a potential to improve the hydrogen discharge rate of MH canisters by utilising its waste heat. However, the added complexity for implementing this idea remains to be a barrier. Open-cathode fuel cells with hot air exiting the cathode side offer an opportunity to simplify its thermal coupling arrangement with MH canisters. The set-up was designed with minimum added parts with just a ducting system to direct the hot exit air from the fuel cell passing over the MH canisters. The experimental results showed that the heat required by the MH canisters to supply enough hydrogen to the fuel cell at 500 W, 1000 W and 2000 W operating points accounts for around 40%, 36.5%, and 32% of the total heat removal from the stack, respectively. The arrangement proved to be feasible for serving its purpose and could eliminate the need for oversizing the MH hydrogen storage system that is normally practised to guarantee the right rate of hydrogen supply at higher power outputs. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This study investigates how the shape and material of the reaction chamber influences the adsorption and desorption rates. Numerical simulations of hydrogen storage in a cylindrical reaction chamber filled with LaNi5 hydride are conducted for a range of chamber thermal conductivities and aspect ratios. The results show that adsorption and desorption processes are limited by thermal diffusion in the hydride bed and storage chamber. A storage efficiency is proposed based on an ideal isothermal process and used to evaluate the impact of chamber thermal conductivity and aspect ratio on the adsorption and desorption rates. Empirical correlations are proposed for predicting the adsorption and desorption efficiency of cylindrical LaNi5 hydride beds. Finally, a machine-learning based data model for predicting storage efficiency in metal hydride chambers is presented. Comparison against the empirical correlations highlights that the machine learning-based data model can predict the storage efficiency more accurately. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Hydrogen storage in underground pipes is more economical than in geological caverns for useable amounts <20-t-H2.

Unlike underground pipes, the installed capital cost of salt caverns decreases appreciably from ~$95/kg-H2 at 100 t-H2 stored to <$19/kg-H2 at 3000 t-H2 stored. Over the same scale, the annual storage cost decreases from ~$17/kg-H2 to ~$3/kg-H2. Like salt caverns, the installed capital cost of lined rock caverns decreases from ~$160/kg-H2 at 100 t-H2 stored to <$44/kg-H2 at 3000 t-H2 stored. Storing >750-t useable H2 requires multiple caverns. The cost of salt caverns scales more favorably with size because the salt caverns are larger than lined rock caverns and need to be added at a slower rate as the storage capacity is increased. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is expected to be highly valuable energy carrier for the 21th century as it should participate in answering main society and economical concerns. To exploit the benefits of this energy at large scale, further research and technological developments are required to secure its storage, especially during fire exposure. Thus, studies on the thermomechanical behaviour of the composite used in the manufacture of tanks for the storage of hydrogen are important. At present, the use of epoxy/carbon fibre composites is developed widely because of its low weight and its good mechanical properties. Thus, the present study focusses on the thermal decomposition property and the influence of a fire or a heating source on the residual mechanical behaviour of such materials. To account for this point, an experimental study is introduced to improve the understanding of thermal decomposition and fire exposure mechanisms of composite using different “elementary” samples. Firstly, to characterize the mechanical properties versus fire exposure, a thermal degradation is performed using a cone calorimeter on composite samples. These tests are led for various heat flux values and are stopped at different characteristic times. Then, the mechanical properties are characterized using tensile test on samples submitted at first to different fire time exposure. The evolution of the elastic properties and ultimate stress show that the density of energy is the main factor leading to a change of the mechanical properties and char thickness evolution. Secondly, to characterize the mechanical properties versus temperature, tensile tests are performed on samples submitted in situ to 4 homogeneous temperature conditions up to 150°C. Finally, A thermomechanical model is proposed to predict the behaviour of composite material. © CCM 2020 - 18th European Conference on Composite Materials. All rights reserved.},

Process heat required for the sulfuric acid decomposition is exclusively generated by a combination of concentrating solar thermal parabolic trough and solar tower systems, which are operated during the daytime only. The proposed design relies on the decoupling of the high temperature section from the rest of the process through material and energy storage for continuous operation. We conceptually design the whole process via steady-state simulation and assess its thermal efficiency and economics. We reveal that the proposed system is comparable to its alternatives in terms of the heat-to-hydrogen efficiency (38.0%) and the levelized cost of hydrogen 10.4$/kgH. Since the levelized cost is primarily attributed to the capital investment, enlarging the proposed system will lead to significant cost reduction due to economies-of-scale. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Laves phases with their comparably simple crystal structure are very common intermetallic phases and can be formed from element combinations all over the periodic table resulting in a huge number of known examples. Even though this type of phases is known for almost 100 years, and although a lot of information on stability, structure, and properties has accumulated especially during the last about 20 years, systematic evaluation and rationalization of this information in particular as a function of the involved elements is often lacking. It is one of the two main goals of this review to summarize the knowledge for some selected respective topics with a certain focus on non-stoichiometric, i.e., non-ideal Laves phases. The second, central goal of the review is to give a systematic overview about the role of Laves phases in all kinds of materials for functional and structural applications. There is a surprisingly broad range of successful utilization of Laves phases in functional applications comprising Laves phases as hydrogen storage material (Hydraloy), as magneto-mechanical sensors and actuators (Terfenol), or for wear- and corrosion-resistant coatings in corrosive atmospheres and at high temperatures (Tribaloy), to name but a few. Regarding structural applications, there is a renewed interest in using Laves phases for creep-strengthening of high-temperature steels and new respective alloy design concepts were developed and successfully tested. Apart from steels, Laves phases also occur in various other kinds of structural materials sometimes effectively improving properties, but often also acting in a detrimental way. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Magnesium hydride is well known as the ideal candidate for solid-state hydrogen storage and thermochemical thermal storage since both gravimetric and volumetric storage are considerably high. The main drawbacks of magnesium hydride are thermodynamic unfavorable and poor kinetic. Adding Nickel as a catalyst, which mainly incorporates mechanical modification (alloying or particle size reduction), can accelerate the reaction rate and decrease the enthalpy formation. It is hard to determine the catalytic of Nickel in magnesium hydride for the kinetic rate improvement. This study is focused on the observation of the effect of Nickel on magnesium hydride by using the market size availability of magnesium and nickel powder (74 μm for Mg and 63 μm for Ni). Mg and Ni are mixed by Ni variation (weight %) from 14%, 15%, and 16%. The characterization starts with initial hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, continues with activation and PCI measurement to obtain the kinetic characteristic of each sample. From this study, it is clear that the increase in nickel ratio will improve the rate of reaction for magnesium hydride, where the maximum storage for magnesium hydride is 4.2% by adding 16 wt% nickel. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

	abstract = {Metal-hydride (MH) reactors are one of the most promising approaches for hydrogen storage because of their low operating pressure, high storage volumetric density and high security. However, the heat transfer performance of the MH reactor for high hydrogenation rate is inferior. In this study, the heat transfer and hydrogen absorption process of metal hydride tank performance in Mg2Ni bed is analyzed numerically using commercial ANSYS-FLUENT software. The MH reactor is considered a cylindrical bed including a helical tube along with a central straight return tube for the cooling fluid. The effects of geometrical parameters including the tube diameter, the pitch size and the coil diameter as well as operational parameters on the heat exchanged and hydrogen absorption reactive time are evaluated comprehensively. The results showed that the helical heat exchanger along with central return tube could effectively improve heat exchanged between the cooling fluid and the metal alloy and reduce the temperature of the bed results in a higher rate of hydrogen absorption. For a proper configuration and geometry of the helical coil heat exchanger with a central return tube, the absorption reaction time is reduced by 24% to reach 90% of the storage capacity. After the optimization study of the geometrical parameters, a system with the heat exchanger tube diameter of 5 mm, coil diameter of 18 mm and the coil pitch value of 10 mm is recommended to have lower hydrogen absorption time and higher hydrogen storage capacity.

	abstract = {Power to hydrogen is a promising solution for storing variable Renewable Energy (RE) to achieve a 100% renewable and sustainable hydrogen economy. The hydrogen-based energy system (energy to hydrogen to energy) comprises four main stages; production, storage, safety and utilisation. The hydrogen-based energy system is presented as four corners (stages) of a square shaped integrated whole to demonstrate the interconnection and interdependency of these main stages. The hydrogen production pathway and specific technology selection are dependent on the type of energy and feedstock available as well as the end-use purity required. Hence, purification technologies are included in the production pathways for system integration, energy storage, utilisation or RE export. Hydrogen production pathways and associated technologies are reviewed in this paper for their interconnection and interdependence on the other corners of the hydrogen square. Despite hydrogen being zero-carbon-emission energy at the end-use point, it depends on the cleanness of the production pathway and the energy used to produce it. Thus, the guarantee of hydrogen origin is essential to consider hydrogen as clean energy.

The crystal structure and guest behaviors of the binary (CBM + CH4) hydrate were investigated through spectroscopic observations, using 13C solid-state NMR and PXRD. Binary (CBM + CH4) hydrate NMR spectra confirmed formation of sII hydrates, indicating that CBM could be enclathrated in the large cages of sII hydrates. CH4 molecules were captured in the large and small cages of sII hydrates; thus, the binary (CBM + CH4) hydrate system could be open to tuning behaviors. The crystal structure of the binary (CBM + CH4) hydrate was confirmed to be a cubic Fd3m hydrate by the Rietveld analysis, with a lattice parameter of 17.23630 Å. CBM inclusion behaviors were elucidated from the shortest distance of the oxygen–oxygen atoms between the host–water and CBM (2.34 Å), and the results indicated that there were possible hydrogen bonding interactions between host and guest. The thermodynamic stability of the binary (CBM + CH4) hydrate was examined, to check the possibility for potential applications in gas storage using gas hydrates. Compared to the equilibrium conditions of pure CH4 hydrates, the equilibrium temperature and pressure of the binary (CBM + CH4) hydrate were more stable. Finally, the CH4 storage capacity of binary (CBM + CH4) hydrate is examined and the results indicate that the CH4 storage capacity of binary (CBM + CH4) hydrate is superior to that of binary (tetrahydrofuran + CH4) and (cyclopentane + CH4) hydrates. These findings may provide fundamental knowledge on the complex nature of host–guest inclusion chemistry, and lend useful insights for its potential application in gas storage using hydrates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Future national electricity, heating, cooling and transport systems need to reach zero emissions. Significant numbers of back-up power plants as well as large-scale energy storage capacity are required to guarantee the reliability of energy supply in 100 percent renewable energy systems. Electricity can be partially converted into hydrogen, which can be transported via pipelines, stored in large quantities in underground salt caverns to overcome seasonal effects and used as electricity storage or as a clean fuel for transport. The question addressed in this paper is how parked and grid-connected hydrogen-fueled Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles might balance 100 per cent renewable electricity, heating, cooling and transport systems at the national level in Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, France and Spain? Five national electricity, heating, cooling and transport systems are modeled for the year 2050 for the five countries, assuming only 50 percent of the passenger cars to be grid-connected Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles, the remaining Battery Electric Vehicles. The grid-connected Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle fleet can always balance the energy systems and their usage is low, having load factors of 2.1–5.5 percent, corresponding to an average use of 190–480 h per car, per year. At peak times, occurring only a few hours per year, 26 to 43 percent of the grid-connected Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle are required and in particular for energy systems with high shares of solar energy, such as Spain, balancing by grid-connected Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles is mainly required during the night, which matches favorably with driving usage. © 2021 The Author(s)},

Firstly, the water-electricity-gas coupling process between the electrolytic cell and the methanation reactor in the power-to-gas system is discussed in detail, and the model of the power-to-gas system based on the coordination of real-time energy conversion and large-scale energy storage is proposed. Then, based on a multi-energy coupling regional integrated energy system, a highly decoupled multi-step modelling method is adopted to construct its optimal operation model, and the equivalent variable substitution method is used to transform it into a linear programming problem. Finally, the calculation results show that the proposed power-to-gas technology can further improve the energy utilization efficiency due to the complementary characteristics of the two functions, so as to effectively promote the implementation of large-scale power-to-gas projects in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This review comprehensively explores the synthesis and performance of Mg-based alloys. Several factors affecting their hydrogen storage performance were also reviewed. The metals addition led to destabilization of Mg–H bonds to boost the dehydrogenation process. A unique morphology could provide more available active sites for the dissociation/recombination of H2 and allow the activation energy reduction. Also, an appropriate support prevent the agglomeration of Mg particles, hence, sustains their nanosize particles. Moreover, the perspective of avenues for future research presented in this review is expected to act as a guide for the development of novel Mg-based H2 storage systems. New morphological shape of catalysts, more unexplored and highly potential waste materials, and numerous synthesis procedures should be explored to further enhance the H2 storage of Mg-based alloys. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

As well as considering the numerous benefits of the realization of underground hydrogen storage (UHS), such as high energy densities, low leakage rates and big storage volumes, risk analysis of UHS is a required step for assessing the suitability of this technology. In this work, a preliminary quantitative risk assessment (QRA) was performed by starting from the worst-case scenario: rupture at the ground of the riser pipe from the salt cavern to the ground. The influence of hydrogen contamination by bacterial metabolism was studied, considering the composition of the gas contained in the salt caverns as time variable. A bow-tie analysis was used to highlight all the possible causes (basic events) as well as the outcomes (jet fire, unconfined vapor cloud explosion (UVCE), toxic chemical release), and then, consequence and risk analyses were performed. The results showed that a UVCE is the most frequent outcome, but its effect zone decreases with time due to the hydrogen contamination and the higher contents of methane and hydrogen sulfide. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is a clean energy source and can be generated from renewable energy resources [1]. In this research a 3D dynamics simulation for stationary hydrogen storage is performed by using COMSOL Multiphysics computational software. The development of a model according to information collected from different references is described as follows. This time dependent model is based on the Laminar Flow and Heat Transfer in Fluids modules. Laminar Flow is used to compute the velocity and pressure fields for the flow of a single-phase fluid. The equations solved by Laminar Flow are the Navier-Stokes equation for conservation of momentum and the continuity equation for conservation of mass. Heat Transfer solves the Navier-Stokes equation together with an energy balance [15]. In the current model, one node implemented was the Inlet, in which a velocity field was used. The flow direction was assumed to be uniform through the injection pipe in the direction of the cylinder axis. Results show various conditions of velocity and pressure fields along with temperature in different locations inside the storage tube produced through the inflow of hydrogen gas. According to the Bernoulli equation, where the velocity field is zero, the pressure is at maximum value. This fact is seen in the results of this simulation in the right half of the tank where the stagnation plane is created. Zero-dimensional modeling has also been carried out to compare with the results. This model shows qualitative agreement with the COMSOL results. © 2020 Begell House Inc.. All rights reserved.},

This paper focuses on the large-scale compressed hydrogen storage options with respect to three categories: storage vessels, geological storage, and other underground storage alternatives. In this study, we investigated a wide variety of compressed hydrogen storage technologies, discussing in fair detail their theory of operation, potential, and challenges. The analysis confirms that a techno-economic chain analysis is required to evaluate the viability of one storage option over another for a case by case. Some of the discussed technologies are immature; however, this does not rule out these technologies; rather, it portrays the research opportunities in the field and the foreseen potential of these technologies.

Meanwhile, the optimal performance of both reactors could be achieved at branch number of 3 and center distance of branch bifurcation point of 8.5 mm. The optimal and sensitivity analysis of 6 operation conditions reveal that both reactors performances are most sensitive to H2 pressure and fluid temperature for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, respectively.

	abstract = {Hydrogen gas is a renewable energy source for electrical and transportation fuel for vehicular applications. However, the storage and transportation of hydrogen gas are challenging because of its very nature and impact on pipelines and storage tank/facility materials. This paper investigates the influence of hydrogen on the candidate fracture toughness (KQ) of low carbon steel immersed in acidic hydrogen environments for one year which has limited previous research. Steel specimens were coated from all sides except one surface to accurately quantify the influence of hydrogen diffusing from the environments into the specimens. Specimens were tested for crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) fracture toughness at six- and twelve-month intervals of immersion in acidic environments. Before KQ testing at various intervals, the hydrogen contents of the specimens were determined by an electrochemical approach. Based on test results, models for the degradation of KQ of steel were developed in accordance with the proposed hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) model (HELP + HEDE model) of hydrogen embrittlement. Furthermore, fractography of the specimens was performed to observe the synergistic action of HELP and HEDE mechanisms (HE), and their subsequent effects on the microstructure and fracture resistance of steel. The significance of the research is highlighted by its practical application for assessing the durability of steel structures and infrastructure against hydrogen environmental assisted cracking (HEAC). Furthermore, this paper highlights the synergistic activity of HELP and HEDE mechanisms of HE in steel and the importance of developing structures for storing hydrogen on a large scale. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Producing Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) via Power-to-Gas (PtG) is favourable for two reasons; it can be substituted for natural gas in the gas network, and it enables CO2 recycling as energy systems transition towards a low-carbon future. However, the expensive SNG production process is a barrier to being cost-competitive with other market gases. Several diverse factors influence SNG production cost, which results in several possible process configurations with varying performance which influence it. The hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) required to produce SNG are available from multiple sources, while the SNG production cost is also influenced by the capital investment required for PtG process units, interim storage facilities, and operating expenses. Hence, an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting SNG production is required to understand their effect on the cost and to provide information on cost savings, economic implications, and optimal SNG production setup for decision-makers. In this paper, an optimisation algorithm is developed to model the PtG process units. The main objective of this work is to determine optimal process configurations for SNG production by analysing its influencing cost factors. A factorial design approach is integrated into the optimisation process to minimise the production cost by choosing the cost-effective process configurations. This work also determines the factors with a significant influence on the production cost using an ANOVA. The algorithm identifies the cost-effective H2 and CO2 source to obtain the least expensive SNG production setup. Based on the values of the cost factors, strategies for lowering the production cost in an existing setup are identified. The factors with the most influence on the SNG production cost are the capacity and capex of the methanator unit © 2021 The Authors},

The numerical model was verified with experiment in terms of crack behaviors and fracture patterns. The tube responses, crack propagations, pressure histories, crack lengths and speeds as well as the energy storages were obtained and analyzed in detailed. It was found the static load case has higher stored energy inside the tube, which causes the larger crack length and speed, as well as the severer bending deformation of tube. The forward crack first run faster under detonation load, but it will be caught up by the backward crack in the late period. The crack growths are incremental under both types of loads. However, the crack growth under detonation load has certain regular patterns, where the oscillating crack speed has a dominant frequency that can be calculated by the proposed formula. Moreover, the quantitative relationship between detonation load speed and the incremental crack growth length was revealed, which is fundamentally and practically useful. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Erythritol (ET) has received increasing research attention for medium-temperature phase change solar-thermal energy storage. However, ET suffers from serious supercooling, low thermal conductivity, poor solar absorption and leakage after melting, which lead to low solar-thermal energy harvesting and releasing efficiency. Herein, we simultaneously overcome these inherent shortcomings by impregnating ET within surface-roughened hydrophilic copper foam, which is prepared by subsequent oxidization of commercial copper foam and thermal reduction under hydrogen, and using stably dispersed crumpled graphene particles as the solar-thermal converter. Such oxidization-reduction-treated copper foam not only provides numerous heterogeneous nucleation sites and lowers the nucleation energy barrier for forming ET crystals during the solidification process, but also facilitates rapid charging and discharging along three-dimensional heat conductive networks, and confines the melted ET. Compared with neat ET, the copper foam-templated composites have reduced the supercooling degree by ~60 °C and improved thermal conductivity by more than 5 times, which in turn lead to a large latent-heat releasing percentage of 85.8% and a high heat-extraction efficiency of 94.2%. We demonstrate that such composites can be used for high-efficiency, medium-temperature, form-stable, direct solar-thermal energy harvesting, and the harvested heat can be readily converted into electricity to power small devices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Porous carbon materials are promising candidate supports for various appli-cations. In a number of these applications, doping of the carbon framework with heteroatoms pro-vides a facile route to readily tune the carbon properties. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where the reaction can be catalyzed without precious metals is one of the common applications for the heteroatom-doped carbons. Therefore, heteroatom doped catalysts might have a promising potential as a cathode in Microbial fuel cells (MFCs). MFCs have a good potential to produce electricity from biological oxidization of wastes at the anode and chemical reduction at the cathode. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been yet reported on utilizing Sulfur trioxide pyridine (STP) and CMK-3 for the preparation of (N and S) doped ordered porous carbon materials. The presence of highly ordered mesostructured and the synergistic effect of N and S atoms with specific structures enhance the oxygen adsorption due to improving the electrocatalytic activity. So the optimal catalyst, with significant stability and excellent tolerance of methanol crossover can be a promising candidate for even other storage and conversion devices. Methods: The physico-chemical properties of the prepared samples were determined by Small Angle X-ray Diffraction (SAXRD), N2 sorption-desorption, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The prepared samples were further applied for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the optimal cathode was tested with the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) system. Furthermore, according to structural analysis, The HRTEM, and SAXRD results confirmed the formation of well-ordered hex-agonal (p6mm) arrays of mesopores in the direction of (100). The EDS and XPS approved that N and S were successfully doped into the CMK-3 carbon framework. Results: Among all the studied CMK-3 based catalysts, the catalyst prepared by STP precursor and pyrolysis at 900°C exhibited the highest ORR activity with the onset potential of 1.02 V vs. RHE and 4 electron transfer number per oxygen molecule in 0.1 M KOH. The high catalyst durability and fuel-crossover tolerance led to stable performance of the optimal cathode after 5000 s operation, while the Pt/C cathode-based was considerably degraded. Finally, the MFC system with the optimal cathode displayed 43.9 mW·m-2 peak power density showing even reasonable performance in comparison to a Pt/C 20 wt.%.cathode. Conclusion: The results revealed that the synergistic effect of nitrogen and sulfur co-doped on the carbon substrate structure leads to improvement in catalytic activity. Also, it was clearly observed that the porous structure and order level of the carbon substrate could considerably change the ORR performance. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {The mathematical model for carbon capture, utilization and storage supply chains is developed for Italian regions. This model is used to design supply chains minimizing total costs and reducing significantly carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide can be stored or utilized to produce methane through a power to gas system, where hydrogen is obtained by the electrolysis of water using renewable power while methane is fed to the gas grid. The Mixed Integer Linear Program model is applied to design carbon systems developed for ten regions with major carbon dioxide emissions, while different saline aquifers are proposed as storage sites. Results show that the Adriatic sea is the most appropriate offshore storage site in the supply chain. This leads to a lower net methane production cost and to the lowest level of economic incentives as compared to other cases. The total costs of this supply chain are 7.34·104 million €/year (953 €/tonCO2 captured), and 16.1 Mton/year of methane are produced. The supply chain does not result economically favorable without substantial financial incentives (80 €/tonCO2 for carbon tax and 260 €/MWh economic incentive for methane production). Comparing supply chains that include simultaneous utilization and storage of carbon dioxide with a carbon capture and utilization supply chain (without storage) shows that the latter is economically less favorable. In addition to mitigation of carbon environmental impact for the whole Country, the large scale supply chain proposed here meets 35% of Italy's methane demand as a whole, a significant contribution to a global economic perspective, widely discussed nowadays, which should include self-sustainment elements at regional level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, the main aim of this review paper is to present the existing challenges and technical solutions to the energy storage of two-wheelers. Indeed, exchanging batteries and swapping metal hydrides hydrogen storage canisters were found to be the appropriate solutions, in which fuel cell and the metal hydride canister could constitute a cogeneration system that the heat needed for hydrogen desorption from the metal hydride canister could be recycled from the waste heat of fuel cell stacks or stored in phase change material during the uptake process. Furthermore, powertrain layouts of the fuel cell two-wheelers and the fuel cell-battery hybrid two-wheelers based on the traditional two-wheeler platforms were also suggested in this paper. More importantly, a novel concept associated with the “zero-emission two-wheeler-building” polygeneration system was also suggested to improve the global energy conversion efficiency. Finally, the energy system of two-wheelers powered by battery, fuel cell, and fuel cell-battery hybrid was thoroughly analyzed and compared. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The transport sector powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) requires novel ap-proaches to achieve near-zero CO2 emissions. In this direction, using CO2 capture and storage (CCS) systems onboard could be a good option. However, CO2 capture in mobile sources is currently challenging due to the operational and space requirements to install a CCS system onboard. This paper presents a systematic review of the CO2 capture in ICE driven transport to know the methods, techniques, and results of the different studies published so far. Subsequently, a case study of a CCS system working in an ICE is presented, where the energy and space needs are evaluated. The review reveals that the most suitable technique for CO2 capture is temperature swing adsorption (TSA). Moreover, the sorbents with better properties for this task are PPN-6-CH2-DETA and MOF-74-Mg. Finally, it shows that it is necessary to supply the energy demand of the CCS system and the option is to take advantage of the waste heat in the flue gas. The case study shows that it is possible to have a carbon capture rate above 68% without affecting engine performance. It was also found that the total volume required by the CCS system and fuel tank is 3.75 times smaller than buses operating with hydrogen fuel cells. According to the review and the case study, it is possible to run a CCS system in the maritime sector and road freight transport. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, for this to happen, new technologies should be fostered, among which a natural gas-based H2 industry can become a key-option. This study tests the hypothesis that the development of a natural gas-based H2 industry equipped with CO2 capture can monetize natural gas remaining resources, mitigate CO2 emissions and facilitate the transition to the renewable energy-based H2. To do that, this study evaluates a stepwise strategy for setting up the development of H2, departing from the idle capacity in the existing natural gas industry, to progressively create a H2 independent supply. Findings indicated that this strategy can be feasible, according to the case study assessed at relatively moderate crude oil prices. Nevertheless, CO2 storage can become a constraint to deal with the co-produced CO2 from the steam methane reforming units. Therefore, it is worth developing storage options. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The growing rate of electricity generation from renewables is leading to new operational and management issues on the power grid because the electricity generated exceeds local requirements and the transportation or storage capacities are inadequate. An interesting option that is under investigation by several years is the opportunity to use the renewable electricity surplus to power electrolyzers that split water into its component parts, with the hydrogen being directly injected into natural gas pipelines for both storage and transportation. This innovative approach merges together the concepts of (i) renewable power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and of (ii) hydrogen blending into natural gas networks. The combination of renewable P2H and hydrogen blending into natural gas networks has a huge potential in terms of environmental and social benefits, but it is still facing several barriers that are technological, economic, legislative. In the framework of the new hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe, Member States should design a roadmap moving towards a hydrogen ecosystem by 2050. The blending of “green hydrogen”, that is hydrogen produced by renewable sources, in the natural gas network at a limited percentage is a key element to enable hydrogen production in a preliminary and transitional phase. Therefore, it is urgent to evaluate at the same time (i) the potential of green hydrogen blending at low percentage (up to 10%) and (ii) the maximum P2H capacity compatible with low percentage blending. The paper aims to preliminary assess the green hydrogen blending potential into the Italian natural gas network as a tool for policy makers, grid and networks managers and energy planners. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {To determine if a power-to-gas pilot-scale plant would be possible in Oregon, a feasibility study was conducted that assessed the technical, political, economic, environmental, safety, and policy aspects of a potential project in the region. The results of this study were submitted as part of Oregon State University – Cascades' entry to the Hydrogen Education Foundation's 2018 student design competition. The Pacific Northwest has a need for long term energy storage (seasonal energy shifting) due to seasonally available low-priced, low-carbon electricity. There appears to be the political motivation and the technical feasibility to install a demonstration-scale power-to-gas plant in the region to assess the technical and economic performance of the system when exposed to real-world boundary conditions. However, preliminary economic analyses show the system will be challenged by low capacity factor operation resulting in a levelized cost of hydrogen of $121.81/kgH2 when only using otherwise curtailed electricity, or $8.84/kgH2 when running continuously for 6 months per annum. To fund a pilot scale plant a renewable gas development surcharge of $0.18/therm is proposed as a way for willing customers to support the decarbonization mission. There is precedent within the utility for such an incentive, indicating that it would be approved by the utility commission and could be a viable path forward for a pilot-scale plant. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {MgH2-based hydrogen storage materials are promising candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage allowing efficient thermal management in energy systems integrating metal hydride hydrogen store with a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) providing dissipated heat at temperatures between 400 and 600 °C. Recently, we have shown that graphite-modified composite of TiH2 and MgH2 prepared by high-energy reactive ball milling in hydrogen (HRBM), demonstrates a high reversible gravimetric H storage capacity exceeding 5 wt % H, fast hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics and excellent cycle stability. In present study, 0.9 MgH2 + 0.1 TiH2 +5 wt %C nanocomposite with a maximum hydrogen storage capacity of 6.3 wt% H was prepared by HRBM preceded by a short homogenizing pre-milling in inert gas. 300 g of the composite was loaded into a storage tank accommodating an air-heated stainless steel metal hydride (MH) container equipped with transversal internal (copper) and external (aluminium) fins. Tests of the tank were carried out in a temperature range from 150 °C (H2 absorption) to 370 °C (H2 desorption) and showed its ability to deliver up to 185 NL H2 corresponding to a reversible H storage capacity of the MH material of appr. 5 wt% H. No significant deterioration of the reversible H storage capacity was observed during 20 heating/cooling H2 discharge/charge cycles. It was found that H2 desorption performance can be tailored by selecting appropriate thermal management conditions and an optimal operational regime has been proposed. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In order to get a high-performance MH-PCM storage tank and understand the effect of mass ratio of PCM to MH on the storage performance, this research proposes a novel MH-PCM storage unit (PCM sandwiched between two layers of MH) stacked inside a cylindrical tank. A mathematical model is established to describe the heat and mass transfer in the process of hydrogen ab/desorption and heat storage/release. It is found that the PCM sandwiched structure has a larger heat transfer area than the surrounding structure, which improves the hydrogen absorption and desorption rate. For the MH-PCM unit, the mass ratio of PCM to MH affects the hydrogen ab/desorption rate. Varying the mass ratio of PCM to MH requires adjustments in the hydrogen absorption pressure for completely absorbing the hydrogen, which also impacts the amount of sensible and latent heat stored in the PCM. The results show that in order to fully absorb the hydrogen, the hydrogen absorption pressure must increase to compensate for reduced mass ratio of PCM to MH, and the ratio of sensible heat to latent heat storage increases. © 2020},

The main function of the PCM is to store the heat released by the MH reactor during the hydrogenation process and reuse it later during the dehydrogenation process. In such a system, the exothermic/endothermic reactions are highly dependent on the heat transfer rate between the MH reactor and the PCM bed. To increase the heat transfer rate, a new configuration of the MH-PCM storage system is proposed. The new configuration consists of an MH reactor encircled by a cylindrical sandwich bed packed with PCM. The results indicate that the proposed configuration of the MH-PCM system improved the heat transfer rate which accordingly reduced the time duration of the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes by 81.5% and 73%, respectively, compared to a conventional MH-PCM system that includes only a single PCM bed. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The subsurface storage of hydrogen (H2) provides a potential solution for load-balancing of the intermittent electricity production from renewable energy sources. In such technical concept, surplus electricity is used to power electrolyzers that produce H2, which is then stored in subsurface formations to be used at times when renewable electricity is not available. Blending H2 with natural gas (NG) for injection into depleted gas/oil reservoirs, which are already used for NG storage, is considered a good option due to the lower initial capital cost and investment needed, and potential lower operating costs. In this study, the potential impact of storing a mixture of H2 and NG in an existing NG storage field was investigated. Relevant reservoir, caprock and cement samples from a NG storage formation in California were characterized with respect to their permeability, porosity, surface area, mineralogy and other structural characteristics, before and after undergoing 3-month incubation experiments with H2/NG gas mixtures at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. The results indicated relatively small changes in porosity and mineralogy due to incubation. However, the observed changes in permeability were more dramatic. In addition, polymeric materials, similar to those used in NG storage operations were also incubated, and their dimensions were measured before and after incubation. These measurements indicated swelling due to the exposure to H2. However, direct evidence of geochemical reactions involving H2 was not observed. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This work focuses on the experimental and numerical investigation of maximum over-pressure and pressure dynamics during ignited hydrogen releases in a storage enclosure, e.g., in marine vessel or rail carriage, with limited vent size area, i.e., the pressure peaking phenomenon (PPP) revealed theoretically at Ulster University in 2010. The CFD model previously validated against small scale experiments in a 1 m3 enclosure is employed here to simulate real-scale tests performed by the University of South-Eastern Norway (USN) in a chamber with a volume of 15 m3. The numerical study compares two approaches on how to model the ignited hydrogen release conditions for under-expanded jets: (1) notional nozzle concept model with inflow boundary condition, and (2) volumetric source model in the governing conservation equations. For the test with storage pressure of 11.78 MPa, both approaches reproduce the experimental pressure dynamics and the pressure peak with a maximum 3% deviation. However, the volumetric source approach reduces significantly the computational time by approximately 3 times (CFL = 0.75). The sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of CFL number, the size of the volumetric source and number of iterations per time step. An approach based on the use of a larger size volumetric source and uni-form coarser grid with a mesh size of a vent of square size is demonstrated to reduce the duration of simulations by a factor of 7.5 compared to the approach with inflow boundary at the notional nozzle exit. The volumetric source model demonstrates good engineering accuracy in predicting experimental pressure peaks with deviation from −14% to +11% for various release and ventilation scenarios as well as different volumetric source sizes. After validation against experiments, the CFD model is employed to investigate the effect of cryogenic temperature in the storage on the overpres-sure dynamics in the enclosure. For a storage pressure equal to 11.78 MPa, it is found that a decrease of storage temperature from 277 K to 100 K causes a twice larger pressure peak in the enclosure due to the pressure peaking phenomenon. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Liquid hydrogen (LH2) attracts widespread attention because of its highest energy storage density. However, evaporation loss is a serious problem in LH2 storage due to the low boiling point (20 K). Efficient insulation technology is an important issue in the study of LH2 storage. Hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) is a potential promising thermal insulation material because of its low apparent thermal conductivity, fast installation (Compared with multi-layer insulation, it can be injected in a short time.), and easy maintenance. A novel cryogenic insulation system consisting of HGMs and a self-evaporating vapor-cooled shield (VCS) is proposed for storage of LH2. A thermodynamic model has been established to analyze the coupled heat transfer characteristics of HGMs and VCS in the composite insulation system. The results show that the combination of HGMs and VCS can effectively reduce heat flux into the LH2 tank. With the increase of VCS number from 1 to 3, the minimum heat flux through HGMs decreases by 57.36%, 65.29%, and 68.21%, respectively. Another significant advantage of HGMs is that their thermal insulation properties are not sensitive to ambient vacuum change. When ambient vacuum rises from 10−3 Pa to 1 Pa, the heat flux into the LH2 tank increases by approximately 20%. When the vacuum rises from 10−3 Pa to 100 Pa, the combination of VCS and HGMs reduces the heat flux into the tank by 58.08%–69.84% compared with pure HGMs. © 2019, Higher Education Press.},

In this study, a modified multilayer MH bed configuration with graded content of expanded natural graphite (ENG) was proposed. A mathematical model was established to obtain the distributions of temperature and reacted fraction within the MH beds during hydrogen absorption. Two comprehensive indices, gravimetric heat storage rate (GHSR) and gravimetric exergy-output rate (GEOR), were adopted to evaluate the heat discharging performance of the MH reactors. The simulation results show that a configuration in which the direction of the ENG content gradient (β) is consistent with the direction of heat flow can improve the performance of the MH reactors. Furthermore, increasing steepness of the ENG content gradient can increase both of the GHSR and the GEOR. The configuration with the squared graded ENG contents (C5-7, β = 3.5 wt%) exhibits the highest GHSR and GEOR values (16.98 and 16.16 W kg−1, respectively), whereas the configuration C1 which employs a uniform ENG content exhibits much lower values of these parameters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Electrical energy storage (EES) is necessary to enable greater penetration of renewables and as a grid-balancing solution, but current EES technologies suffer from capacity or geological limitations and high cost. Reversible solid oxide cells (ReSOCs) are an electrochemical energy conversion technology that can produce both electricity from fuel (gas-to-power) and fuel from electricity (power-to-gas), depending on resource availability and demand. Leveraging in situ C-O-H chemistry and operating at intermediate temperature (600°C) and elevated pressure (10–20 bar) enables these cells to be mildly exothermic, eliminating the need for external heat input or high over-potential (low-efficiency) operation during electrolysis mode. This operating strategy also results in higher methane production during electrolysis, facilitating easier integration with natural gas pipeline infrastructure over steam/hydrogen electrolytic processes. This study proposes a ReSOC system integrated with both natural gas pipeline and carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure to render a flexible, grid energy management resource. In gas-to-power mode, the system takes natural gas from a pipeline to produce electricity. Un-utilized fuel is combusted with oxygen and expanded through a turbine to produce more power. The water in the exhaust is condensed, and the remaining carbon dioxide is compressed for tanker or pipeline transportation to a carbon sequestration site. In power-to-gas mode, carbon dioxide and water are co-electrolyzed in the stack to produce methane and hydrogen, which can be injected directly into a natural gas pipeline or further refined into a purer stream of methane. We explore system design concepts, performance, and cost of a 50 MWe ReSOC system. Results indicate that synthetic natural gas (92.0% methane) can be produced at $22.7/MMBTU with a lower heating value efficiency of 81%. Alternatively, a system that net meters produced syngas and operates in power producing mode 50% of the time can generate electricity at a levelized cost of 10.5 ¢/kWh with an efficiency of 69% (LHV), while producing exhaust that is 95.5% carbon dioxide at 40 bar. If the system operates disproportionally in gas-to-power mode the LCOE drops to near 6 ¢/kWh. The economic outlook for mature ReSOC systems presented herein are found to be competitive with current energy storage technologies and natural gas peaker plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Molecular hydrogen is the most optimistic solution for achieving a carbon-neutral energy economy, and it requires scientific intervention for its production, storage, and transportation. In the present time, hydrogen is produced primarily from conventional fossil fuels. Hydrogen production from natural gas using partial oxidation and steam reforming processes is a relatively mature process. However, several modifications and improvements are being researched. Hydrogen generation from potential renewable and biological sources such as water splitting and biomass conversion are propitious approaches. Hydrogen is one of the smallest molecules, and the volumetric efficiency of its storage is quite poor. The creative and innovative ways for molecular hydrogen storage, including pressurized, liquified, physically adsorbed, chemically adsorbed, and in the form of gas hydrates, are being investigated. The delay in developing a systematic and mature hydrogen economy is mainly due to challenging storage conditions and the safety aspect of its transportation. Hythane, a patented mixture of hydrogen and natural gas, can act as a bridge for the hydrogen economy by sharing the current natural gas infrastructure. This review delivers an extensive understanding of the properties of hythane fuel with a brief history. Hydrogen addition can increase NOx emissions due to exceptional heat generation that can be solved to a certain extent with the approach of inventive technologies developed for internal combustion engines, including three-way catalyst, lean burn combustion, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and direct fuel injection (DFI).  © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

The model was firstly validated through comparison with previous literature experimental data. An excellent fit of the experimental data has been obtained by our model. The sensitively of the bed-temperature and the metal hydrogenation degree to the variation of the thermal conductivity of the metal (λ), hydrogen pressure supply (P), reaction rate constant (Ca) and activation energy (Ea) has been shown. In all cases, the bed temperature increased suddenly up to maxima (after ∼100 s of filling) and then decreased exponentially up to attaining the ambient temperature. Simultaneously, the absorbed concentration of hydrogen showed an initial quick increase at the first 50 s and then the profile continuous linearly with much lower slope up to reaching complete hydrogenation of the metal. Increasing λ has not impacted the hydrogenation rate and the charging bed-temperature, but it accelerated the convective cooling of the bed reactor. Operating at higher hydrogen pressure supply has increased the hydrogenation rate as well as the bed temperature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Intermittency is one of the main obstacles that inhibit the wide adoption of the renewable energy in the power sector. Small-scale fluctuations can be tackled by short-term energy storage system, whereas long-term or seasonal intermittencies rely on large-scale energy management solutions. Besides the supply and demand mismatch in temporal domain, renewable energy sources are usually far away from consumption points. To connect the energy sources to the demand cost-effectively, cable transmission is usually the default option, and considering the long distance, other emerging energy carriers such as hydrogen could be a feasible option. However, there is handful studies on the quantitative evaluation of the long-distance energy transmission cost. This paper investigated the economic feasibility of renewable energy transmission via routes of power cable and gas pipeline. In the direct power transmission case, renewable energy is transmitted via HVDC cable and then converted to hydrogen for convenient storage. The alternative case converts renewable energy into hydrogen at the source and transports the hydrogen in the gas pipeline to consumers. Existing data available from public domain are used for cost estimation. Results show that the improvements of capacity factor and transmission scale are the most cost-effective approach to make the renewable hydrogen economically viable. At 4000 km of transmission distance, renewable hydrogen LCOE of 7 US$/kg and 9 US$/kg are achievable for the corresponding optimum cases, respectively. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

As a result, decades of studies has led to a wide range of hydrides that can store hydrogen in a solid form. Applications of these solid-state hydrides are well-suited to stationary applications. However, the main challenge arises in making the selection of the Metal Hydrides (MH) that are best suited to meet application requirements. Herein, we discuss the current state-of-art in controlling the properties of room temperature (RT) hydrides suitable for stationary application and their long term behavior in addition to initial activation, their limitations and emerging trends to design better storage materials. The hydrogen storage properties and synthesis methods to alter the properties of these MH are discussed including the emerging approach of high-entropy alloys.

	abstract = {The greatest lever for advancing climate adaptation and mitigation is the defossilization of energy systems. A key opportunity to replace fossil fuels across sectors is the use of renewable hydrogen. In this context, the main political and social push is currently on climate neutral hydrogen (H2 ) production through electrolysis using renewable electricity. Another climate neutral possibility that has recently gained importance is biohydrogen production from biogenic residual and waste materials. This paper introduces for the first time a novel concept for the production of hydrogen with net negative emissions. The derived concept combines biohydrogen production using biotechnological or thermochemical processes with carbon dioxide (CO2 ) capture and storage. Various process combinations referred to this basic approach are defined as HyBECCS (Hydrogen Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) and described in this paper. The technical principles and resulting advantages of the novel concept are systematically derived and compared with other Negative Emission Technologies (NET). These include the high concentration and purity of the CO2 to be captured compared to Direct Air Carbon Capture (DAC) and Post-combustion Carbon Capture (PCC) as well as the emission-free use of hydrogen resulting in a higher possible CO2 capture rate compared to hydrocarbon-based biofuels generated with Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technologies. Further, the role of carbon-negative hydrogen in future energy systems is analyzed, taking into account key societal and technological drivers against the background of climate adaptation and mitigation. For this purpose, taking the example of the Federal Republic of Germany, the ecological impacts are estimated, and an economic assessment is made. For the production and use of carbon-negative hydrogen, a saving potential of 8.49–17.06 MtCO2, eq/a is estimated for the year 2030 in Germany. The production costs for carbon-negative hydrogen would have to be below 4.30 € per kg in a worst-case scenario and below 10.44 € in a best-case scenario in order to be competitive in Germany, taking into account hydrogen market forecasts. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The lack of hydrogen (H2) transportation infrastructure restricts the development of the H2 industry. Owing to the high investment of building specific facilities, using existing natural gas (NG) pipelines to transport a blend of H2 and NG (H2NG) is a viable means of transportation and approach for large-scale long-time storage. However, variation in the thermo-physical properties of an H2NG blend will impact the performance of pipeline appliances. To address the gaps in H2 transmission via an NG system in the context of energy consumption, in the present paper, a one-dimensional pipeline model is proposed to predict the blended flow in a real existing pipeline (Shan–Jing I, China). The data of NG components were derived from real gas fields. Furthermore, the influence of H2 fractions on pipeline energy coefficient and the layout of pressurization stations are comprehensively analyzed. In addition, the case of intermediate gas injection is investigated, and the effects of injection positions are studied. This study serves as a useful reference for the design of an H2NG pipeline system. The present study reveals that with the increasing in H2 fraction, the distance between pressure stations increases. Furthermore, when the arrangement of original pressure stations is maintained, overpressure occur. Intermediate gas injection results in the inlet pressure of subsequent pressurization stations reducing. Using existing pipeline network to transport H2NG, it is necessary to make appropriate adjustment. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Teng, Liu, Han and Li.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates a pioneering technology adaption for using a membrane-based subsea storage solution for oil/condensate, modified into storing clean energy storage in the form of ammonia (as a hydrogen energy carrier). The immediate application will provide an economical alternative to electrification of offshore platforms, instead of using expensive cables from shore. Storing ammonia at the seabed using innovative subsea storage technologies will dramatically reduce CO2 emissions for offshore assets. The fluid will be stored in a safe manner on the seafloor, protecting both personnel and marine life. The next step will be to include subsea ammonia storage as part of the global logistical value chain, which can power the merchant shipping fleet. Clean ammonia can be produced using renewable resources as wind or solar. It focuses on bridging the ongoing oil/condensate storage qualification, adapted into storing ammonia. The large-scale verification test scope is explained, and we show how the test is extended to also prove the concept of safe energy/ammonia storage. The ammonia storage concept is explained, and we show how this can be included as part of a low carbon future. The focus is the immediate market for providing clean power to existing or new offshore assets. The full system solution will encompass storage tanks placed nearby the platforms at safe water depths, riser systems providing fuel to the ammonia power generators, and the tank filling systems. Bridging and adapting technologies from the petroleum industry into renewables shows the importance of utilizing the technology developments and competence of the oil and gas business. The technical evaluations have shown that the oil/condensate storage can be adapted into storing energy/ ammonia with minor modifications. Converting hydrogen into ammonia gives slight energy losses, but it is defended by the large economic benefits of storing ammonia versus pressure storage of hydrogen. The paper presents qualification work already completed and how to implement ammonia fuel storage for platforms. In addition, we show the test setup for a large-scale qualification provided by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) company together with major Operators. Innovative modular design methods have shown that the concept can be included on existing offshore assets, which have limited topside space available. Adding green or blue ammonia as an alternative to power cables from shore have several benefits, and many of the connecting building blocks are falling into place. The main conclusion is how to adapt Novel technologies from the oil industry to store ammonia in a safe way on the seafloor. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference. All rights reserved.},

In both approaches the mass and momentum balance from the throat to the notional nozzle are solved, while the temperature at the notional nozzle was assumed equal to the nozzle temperature in the first approach and was calculated by an energy balance in the second approach. The two approaches gave identical results. Satisfactory agreement with the measurements was found in terms of centerline mass fraction and temperature. However, for test with 3 and 4 bar release the concentration was overpredicted. Furthermore, a wider radial spread was observed in the predictions possibly revealing higher degree of diffusion using the k-ε turbulence model. An integral model for cryogenic jets was also developed and provided good results. Finally, a test simulation was performed with an ambient temperature jet and compared to the cold jet showing that warm jets decay faster than cold jets. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The hydrogen storage of metal hydrides (MHs) is an exothermic process. The reaction enthalpy of magnesium hydride is 75 kJ/mol. Phase change materials (PCM) can be integrated with a MH hydrogen storage tank (MHST) to recycle the absorption heat as the heat source for desorption. To improve the heat transfer and hydrogen storage performance, this work comparatively studied the various configurations of the PCM based MHST. A numerical model is built to trace the transfer and storage process for two MHSTs with the PCM surrounded layout and sandwiched MH-PCM units. The results show that the configuration methods of PCM affects the hydrogen storage performance. The sandwiched MH-PCM units has faster heat transfer and reaction rate for the larger heat transfer area and smaller thermal resistance. The amount of PCM affects the reaction fraction due to the heat storage capacity. For the MHST with sandwiched MH-PCM units, when the amount of PCM is sufficient, the reduction of PCM will slightly decrease the average absorption rate and increase the average desorption rate by 21.8%. Considering the weight of PCM, the quantitative relationship is established among the mass ratio of PCM to MH, the maximum conversion rate of MgH2 and the actual gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity. When the amount of PCM is just sufficient, there is a maximum gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of 0.733 wt%. © 2021},

	abstract = {Decarbonization plays an important role in future energy systems for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and establishing a zero-carbon society. Hydrogen is believed to be a promising secondary energy source (energy carrier) that can be converted, stored, and utilized efficiently, leading to a broad range of possibilities for future applications. Moreover, hydrogen and electricity are mutually converted, creating high energy security and broad economic opportunities toward high energy resilience. Hydrogen can be stored in various forms, including compressed gas, liquid hydrogen, hydrides, adsorbed hydrogen, and reformed fuels. Among these, liquid hydrogen has advantages, including high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen densities and hydrogen purity. However, liquid hydrogen is garnering increasing attention owing to the demand for long storage periods, long transportation distances, and economic performance. This paper reviews the characteristics of liquid hydrogen, liquefaction technology, storage and transportation methods, and safety standards to handle liquid hydrogen. The main challenges in utilizing liquid hydrogen are its extremely low temperature and ortho-to para-hydrogen conversion. These two characteristics have led to the urgent development of hydrogen liquefaction, storage, and transportation. In addition, safety standards for handling liquid hydrogen must be updated regularly, especially to facilitate massive and large-scale hydrogen liquefaction, storage, and transportation. © 2021 by the author.

	abstract = {The burst strength of tube and casing is important to the storage and development of hydrogen gas and natural gas. Studies on the current classic models to calculate burst pressure of tube and casing show that they are not suitable to predict the burst pressure of tube and casing under modern manufacturing technology level due to without considering the effects of radius-thickness ratio and practical service environment (capped-end condition and capped-open conditions). Hence, for the thin-wall (20＜D/t＜40) tube and casing, based on the deformation instability and finite strain theory, this paper has established the equations to calculate burst pressure of thin-wall pipe under capped-end condition and capped-open conditions by adopting the power-law constitutive relation. For the thick-wall (5 ≤ D/t ≤ 20) tube and casing, based on the failure criterion of through-wall yield, the unified algorithms of burst pressure for thick-wall pipe under capped-end condition and capped-open condition have been derived by adopting unified strength theory. The burst pressure model which can calculate the burst pressure of thick-wall pipe under modern manufacturing technology level, has been presented combining with weighting twin shear stress yield criterion. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the calculated results of this equation are closest to the test data, and its accuracy and reliability are obviously superior to other models, and the service environment of tube and casing has a great impact on the burst pressure. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Energy storage systems (ESS) are promising solutions for these challenges. However, considering the marginal capacity of ESSs according to the installation area and the economic portion of ESSs according to the installation capacity, the use of battery ESSs to reduce surplus energy is not efficient and has practical limitations. To efficiently resolve the challenges, a multi-energy system (MES) that is capable of operating different energy sources, such as natural gas storage (NGS), thermal energy storage (TES), ice energy storage (IES), and hydrogen energy storage (HES) has been proposed. The centerpiece of converting and managing multiple energy sources associated with the MES is the energy hub (EH). In this paper, we reviewed and compared the performance of existing ESSs and the MES, and the results have demonstrated the superiority of the MES. In addition, EHs that include power-to-gas, combined heat power, and combined cooling heat power, have been examined based on their structural characteristics.

	abstract = {A large-capacity hydrogen storage system, which is also able to purify the hydrogen during storage, is appealing and bears significance for the mobile hydrogen use systems which require highly pure hydrogen, since it improves the adaptability of these systems to hydrogen fuels of different purity grades. Inspired by the fact that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanoporous graphene (NPG) membranes have the ability to adsorb and separate gases, respectively, a concept for a constant-pressure integrated hydrogen purification and storage system composed of these two carbon-based materials is proposed. In this integrated system, hydrogen is stored by the adsorption of CNTs and purified by the two-layer nanoporous graphene membranes during the permeation driven by hydrogen concentration difference at constant pressure. The molecular dynamics simulation for the purification and storage processes was carried out with the open source software LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), by which the purification efficiency and hydrogen storage capacity under different working conditions were investigated. The results showed that the preferable working parameters for the purification and storage processes are different, and thus the determination of theses parameters should strike a balance between their effects on both storage and purification processes. Through comparative studies, it was found that the system can obtain the best performance of purification and hydrogen storage at the feed-hydrogen temperature, adsorption temperature, and working pressure of 300 K, 60 K, and 15 MPa, respectively, with the storage density and hydrogen purity of 4.57 wt % and 95% (75% before purification), respectively. The integrated hydrogen storage and purification system proposed in this paper, although just a concept, can provide a theoretical reference for designing large-capacity hydrogen storage systems for equipment which requires highly pure hydrogen.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

These variable renewable energy sources require an energy storage solution to allow a smooth integration of these sources. Batteries can provide short-term storage solutions. However, there is still a need for technologies that can provide weekly energy storage at locations without potential for pumped hydro storage. This paper presents innovative solutions for energy storage based on “buoyancy energy storage” in the deep ocean. The ocean has large depths where potential energy can be stored in gravitational based energy storage systems. The deeper the system, the greater the amount of stored energy. The cost of Buoyancy Energy Storage Technology (BEST) is estimated to vary from 50 to 100 USD/kWh of stored electric energy and 4,000 to 8,000 USD/kW of installed capacity. BES could be a feasible option to complement batteries, providing weekly storage cycles.

	abstract = {Hydrogen fuel cells are received increasingly wide attention in order to develop green ships and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the field of waterway transportation. Metal hydrides (MHs) can be used to store hydrogen for green ships due to their high volumetric storage capacity and safety. Various measures should be considered in the design and manufacture process of the MH reactor to strengthen its performance of heat and mass transfer and obtain an acceptable hydrogen storage capacity. In this work, LaNi5 hydride is used as the hydrogen storage material and packed in the reactor. A basic axisymmetric numerical model for the hydrogen storage system without a heat exchanger has been developed and proved to be effective through the comparison between its simulation results and the published data during dehydriding. A hybrid heat exchanger, which is consisted of a phase change material (PCM) jacket and a coiled-tube, has been applied into the hydrogen storage system to relieve the thermal effect of MH in the dehydriding process on system performance. Effects of the heat transfer coefficient between the circulating heating water in the coil-tube and the MH bed, the temperature of circulating heating water and the pressure at the outlet on the dehydriding performance have been investigated. Based on parametric study, the relationships among the average dehydriding rate, the heat transfer coefficient, the heating water temperature and the outlet pressure have been found and fitted as simple equations. These fitted equations can be considered as a reference, which provides an important method to effectively control the dehydriding rate in order to satisfy the fuel requirement of the power unit and ensure the safe navigation of green ships in the future. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The network storage capability of district heating systems and gas systems can provide a considerable flexibility in integrated energy systems, increasing the use of volatile renewable energy generation. But the stronger the single energy systems are linked the more complex their operation becomes due to their increased interactions. To ensure a secure and reliable system operation while using the full potential of integrated energy systems, these interactions must be analyzed. Existing power flow calculation methods, however, assume a steady-state behavior of all energy systems in the integrated energy system, neglecting the network storage capability. Hence, this paper presents a joined quasi-steady-state power flow calculation method for integrated energy systems. Our method introduces the dynamic behavior of the district heating system arising from the temperature propagation and the dynamic behavior of the gas system due to the gas compressibility and propagation of hydrogen. In a comparison with a steady-state power flow calculation we show the considerable effect of the network storage on the operation of an integrated energy system. As our method enhances existing steady-state power flow calculation methods, it can be easily used for the same use cases but allowing the full potential of integrated energy systems to be investigated.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Energy storage is a very wide and variegate topic in which several aspects – from material and process design, control and optimisation, economic and environmental aspects, specific application, etc. – play a fundamental role. The present paper offers a critical overview of the main energy storage to help readers navigate across the different technologies available to store energy, their current development status, common applications and future research trends and opportunities. Due to the complexity of the topic, the paper focuses the attention on thermal and electrochemical energy storage and their synergies with the development of renewable energy source technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy storage through Metal Hydride (MH) reactors has various applications in concentrated solar powers and fuel cells for stationary applications in renewable energy systems. Hydrogen storage performance and consumption of these systems are strongly dependent on heat and mass transfer characteristics. Incorporating Phase Change Materials (PCMs) and spiral tube heat exchangers into metal hydride reactors improves storage performance significantly. The present paper includes a numerical investigation on the storage performance of a novel Porous Metal Hydride Tank (PMHT) integrated with PCM as a passive heat transfer system. Moreover, a heat exchanger with newly-offered Flat Spiral Tube Planes (FSTPs) is mounted into a reactor for heat transfer enhancement. The air as Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) flows into the metal reactor through a spiral tube to enhance the heat and mass transfer. The effects of various spiral configurations, different shapes, and thicknesses of PCM jackets on the absorption/desorption process of hydrogen are investigated in detail. Also, various inlet temperatures are applied to the system to examine its impact on the absorption/desorption process. According to the results, increasing the number of FSTPs along the PMHT reduces the absorption duration by 8%. Moreover, compared with PMHT without PCM, the absorption and desorption performance of PCM-based PMHT is improved by 44% and 20%, respectively. Furthermore, increasing and decreasing the air inlet temperature leads to a 43% and 47% reduction in total desorption and absorption duration, respectively. Finally, conical-shaped PCM-jackets are found to be capable of demonstrating better absorption and desorption performances. They offer the advantage of less PCM usage to provide even a higher performance than annulus PCM-jackets. In this regard, the conical-shaped PCM provides the means for the PMHT to reach its maximum hydrogen absorption by only 85% usage of its PCM volume. In comparison, annulus-shaped PCM uses 98% of its PCM volume to help the PMHT reach its maximum hydrogen absorption capability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy is a clean, efficient and renewable energy source. Compared with compressed gaseous hydrogen (GH2) storage and metal hydride storage, liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage has advantages of high energy density and storage efficiency. Excellent insulation system can effectively reduce heat leak into LH2 tank and evaporation loss. In comparison with vaporization heat (449 kJ/kg) of H2, the sensible heat (from 20 K to 300 K, 3509 kJ/kg) and combustion heat (140 MJ/kg) are considerable. In this paper, thermoacoustic refrigerator shield (TRS) and self-evaporating vapor cooled shield (VCS) are introduced into different insulation materials to recover the sensible heat and combustion heat of discharged GH2. The proposed insulation system is independent of external power supply and can realize efficient LH2 storage without H2 emission into ambient, which can be used in skid-mounted LH2 storage tanks for remote areas. A self-built thermodynamic model, which has been verified by test results, is used to analyze the insulation performance with VCS and TRS quantitatively. For the proposed insulation system, the heat flux into tank with VCS decreased by 70.98% and TRS by 90.81%. The effects of hot boundary temperature, LH2 storage pressure and insulation material type on the insulation performance have been analyzed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the synthesis of ammonia with chemical methods, global carbon emission is the biggest threat to global warming. However, the dependence of the agricultural industry on ammonia production brings with it various research studies in order to minimize the carbon emission that occurs with the ammonia synthesis process. In order to completely eliminate the carbon emissions from ammonia production, both the hydrogen and the energy needed for the operation of the process must be obtained from renewable sources. Thus, hydrogen can be produced commercially in a variety of ways. Many processes are discussed to accompany the Haber Bosch process in ammonia production as potential competitors. In addition to parameters such as temperature and pressure, various plasma catalysts are being studied to accelerate the ammonia production reaction. In this study, various alternative processes for the capture, storage and complete removal of carbon gas released during the current ammonia production are evaluated and the current conditions related to the applicability of these processes are discussed. In addition, it has been discussed under which conditions it is possible to produce larger capacities as needed in the processes studied in order to reduce carbon gas emissions during ammonia production in order to provide raw material source for fertilizer production and energy sector. However, if the hydrogen gas required for ammonia production is produced using a solid oxide electrolysis cell, the reduction in the energy requirement of the process and in this case the reduction of energy costs shows that it will play an important role in determining the method to be used for ammonia production. In addition, it is predicted that working at lower temperature (<400 °C) and pressure (<10 bar) values in existing ammonia production technologies, despite increasing possible energy costs, will significantly reduce process operating costs. © 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {When a station blackout accident occurs in a nuclear power plant, active cooling of spent nuclear fuels stored in a water pool using pumps is not available. As a result, the stagnant water in the pool gradually heats up via decay heat from the spent fuels and evaporates, thus exposing the spent fuels to air. This rapidly overheats the spent fuels and produces hydrogen gas due to oxidation of the zircaloy cladding. Accumulation of hydrogen gas can result in harmful detonation in the spent fuel storage building similar to what occurred in the Fukushima accident. In this study, a new concept of a gravity-assisted heat pipe that removes decay heat of spent fuels in a water pool by natural convection of ambient air is proposed. In the design, the condenser at the top of the heat pipe consists of several finned tubes for passive air cooling while the evaporator at the bottom is a single rod submerged in the spent fuel pool, which is called fork-end heat pipe (FEHP). A theoretical analysis model of a FEHP was developed and a laboratory-scale specimen was manufactured and tested for validation. It was found that the developed theoretical analysis model reasonably predicted the heat transfer rate of the FEHP specimen at diverse operating conditions and the operating limit point where the heat transfer rate is maximized due to the counter-current flow limit phenomenon. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Power-to-gas (PtG) has been proposed in the last years as one of the most promising energy storage technologies. PtG converts surplus electricity into synthetic natural gas by combining water electrolysis and CO2methanation. This technology valorises captured CO2to produce a 'CO2neutral' natural gas, while allowing the temporal displacement of renewable energy. Thus, the interconnection of the electric and gas grids leads to higher flexibility of the energy supply. The PtG-Oxycombustion hybridization is proposed to integrate mass and energy flows of the global system. In oxy-fuel combustion carbon capture, a mixture of pure oxygen and recycled flue gas (mainly CO2and H2O) acts as oxidizing agent. The requirement of an air separation unit (ASU) to produce oxygen would be replaced by an electrolyser which by-produces O2. Thus, the electrical consumption of the ASU would be reduced or avoided, and CO2would be taken from flue gas without extra energy penalty in its separation. The research group has carried out several projects related to PtG-Oxycombustion. The MERCURIA project (ENE2016-76850-R) focuses on the design, construction and testing of a methanator at laboratory scale (1-5 kW of hydrogen input). The objective is to characterize the experimental production of synthetic methane under different temperatures and pressures, as well as quantify potential integrations of the technology in different industrial sectors. First results to be presented comprise the design of the lab-scale system. © ECOS 2020.All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Shale gas-produced water (PW), the waste fluid generated during gas production, contains a large number of organic contaminants and high salinity matrix. Previous studies generally focused on the end-of-pipe treatment of the PW and ignored the early collection process. In this study, the transformation of the molecular composition and microbial community structure of the PW in the transportation and storage process (i.e., from the gas–liquid separator to the storage tank) were investigated. As the PW was transported from the gas–liquid separator to the portable storage tank, the dissolved organic matter (DOM) showed greater saturation, less oxidation, and lower polarity. DOMs with high O/C and low H/C ratios (numbers of oxygen and hydrogen divided by numbers of carbon) were eliminated, which may be due to precipitation or adsorption by the solids suspended in the PW. The values of double-bond equivalent (DBE), DBE/C (DBE divided by the number of carbon), and aromatic index (AI) decreased, likely because of the microbial degradation of aromatic compounds. The PW in the gas–liquid separator presented a lower biodiversity than that in the storage tank. The microbial community in the storage tank showed the coexistence of anaerobes and aerobes. Genera related to biocorrosion and souring were detected in the two facilities, thus indicating the necessity of more efficient anticorrosion strategies. This study helps to enhance the understanding of the environmental behavior of PW during shale gas collection and provides a scientific reference for the design and formulation of efficient transportation and storage strategies to prevent and control the environmental risk of shale gas-derived PW. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Current greenhouse gas emissions suggest that keeping global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees, as espoused in the Paris Agreements will be challenging, and to do so, the achievement of carbon neutrality is of utmost importance. It is also clear that no single solution can meet the carbon neutral challenge, so it is essential for scientific research to cover a broad range of technologies and initiatives which will enable the realization of a carbon free energy system. This study details the broad, yet targeted research themes being pioneered within the International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (I2CNER). These approaches include hydrogen materials, bio-mimetic catalysts, electrochemistry, thermal energy and absorption, carbon capture, storage and management and refrigerants. Here we outline the state of the art for this suite of technologies and detail how their deployment, alongside prudent energy policy implementation can engender a carbon neutral Japan by 2050. Recognizing that just as no single technological solution will engender carbon neutrality, no single nation can expect to achieve this goal alone. This study represents a recognition of conducive international policy agendas and is representative of interdisciplinary, international collaboration. © 2022 The Chemical Society of Japan.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage systems (HSSs), are the backbone of feasible hydrogen economy. To provide a reliable renewable energy system, safe, cost effective and compact HSS is due. Physical storage systems involve the compressed gas, liquid and cryo-compressed techniques while material based one involves adsorptive materials, metal hydrides and chemical storage materials. In this paper, the features of a variety of HSSs are impartially discussed. The technical comparative analysis of the different physical and material based types of HSSs illustrates the paradoxical inherent features, including gravimetric and volumetric storage densities and parameters associated with storage and release processes, among these systems. Accordingly, no ideal hydrogen storage technique can be considered the best-fit for all stationary and automotive applications. Therefore, not only a unique HSS solution can properly provide the needs, but a set of complementary HSS solutions which may offer the system designer several options. This set of options can be hardly interpretable in case of the unclear definition of the application needs which may be time variant. Inside this review, the critical insights and recommendations about suitable applications for storage systems are provided. Different standards and codes alongside the corresponding tests are demonstrated for the different storage technologies. Moreover, storage vessels research work is overviewed for the different hydrogen storage technologies. In addition, the failure behaviour, criteria and prediction models are investigated for composite vessels subjected to high pressures and extreme temperatures degrading their mechanical behaviour and failure resistance. © 2021},

	abstract = {The introduction of hydrogen or synthetic natural gas produced from renewable electricity into gas pipelines is being considered to enable decarbonization and energy storage. Prior published studies show that hydrogen concentrations over 20-30% are likely to require significant infrastructure modifications and that significant concentrations of hydrogen will decrease energy transport capacity and/or reduce transport efficiency due to higher compression work. A comparative analysis of four power-To-gas implementations utilizing alk aline electrolysis, steam methane reforming, and catalytic methanation at hydrogen concentrations from 0-100% is performed in order to quantify production and transport power requirements utilizing pipeline or electrical transport. The pipeline transport analysis evaluates the pipeline transport capacity, efficiency, and emissions at various hydrogen concentrations and their sensitivity to pipeline diameter and compressor station spacing. The results show that production costs for hydrogen and synthetic natural gas dominate the overall energy requirement, requiring more power to create product than will be delivered for end use. Pipeline transport power requirements also increase by a maximum factor of 6-8 depending on surface roughness at high hydrogen percentages, but pipeline transport losses are less than electrical transmission losses in all cases. The increased pipeline compression power increases CO2 emissions along the pipeline up to a peak value of 240% relative to pure methane at a mole fraction of 65% hydrogen, above which CO2 emissions reduce. An analysis of pipeline compression conditions shows that flow requirements for all cases exceed the capabilities of reciprocating compressors but are mostly within the capabilities of centrifugal compressors, although multiple bodies may be required at hydrogen concentrations exceeding approximately 40-85%. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

	abstract = {Solar energy is considered to be one of the most promising renewable and sustainable energy sources. Two key technologies such as photovoltaic and concentrated solar power are mainly used to convert solar radiation, out of which photovoltaic directly converts solar radiation into electricity, while concentrated solar power technology converts solar radiation both into heat and electricity. The key advantages of concentrated solar power technology over photovoltaic is its capability of storing heat energy which can be utilised in the absence of sunlight, overcoming the limitation of the intermittent nature of solar power. Currently, the cost for the concentrated solar power with storage is about 9.0 ¢/kWh (same as commercial photovoltaic system), which is expected to drop at ~5.0 ¢/kWh by 2030. Besides four mainstream concentrated solar power technologies, this paper reviewed the application of concentrated solar power in thermolysis, thermochemical cycle, hydrocarbon cracking, reforming and solar gasification. Based on the literature review, this study has outlined the key challenges and prospects of concentrated solar power technologies. The main challenge in thermolysis is the requirement of very high temperature, while the thermochemical cycle is inefficient. Solar thermal cracking, reforming, and gasification integrate carbonaceous fuel to produce synthesis gas and hydrogen and therefore are not emission-free. The concentrated solar power technologies require further development and cost reductions before they can be scaled up to have a meaningful impact on renewable energy targets towards 2050. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The LCORE methodology accounts for capital costs, financing costs, operation and maintenance costs, energy efficiency of each step, technology lifetime, and replacement costs. Results show that the most valuable use of the renewable hydrogen is as fuel for fuel cell electric vehicles, although the costs of the hydrogen fueling infrastructure are estimated to be high using the existing paradigm of trucking, compression, and dispensing (adding more than $7/kilogram to the price of hydrogen). Importantly, the analyses show that the range of costs for pathways that produce hydrogen by electrolysis from renewable generation and return it to the electric grid using the natural gas system to transport the hydrogen to an existing combined cycle plant to produce the electricity have costs of $76-$210/MWh. These costs are directly competitive with battery energy storage pathways at $51-$150/MWh while also providing energy storage over durations as long as months, durations that are that are not technically feasible for many battery technologies due to charge leakage. © 2020 ECS-The Electrochemical Society.},

The PCM numerical model is newly developed and incorporated into the metal hydride (MH) model, which was presented earlier [1]. It is based on the enthalpy-porosity formulation and considers source/sink terms in energy and momentum conservation equations. The study explores the effects of metal foam incorporated into PCM, and the variation of its porosity and pore density towards better heat transfer, and hydrogen charging and discharging rates. Detailed performance analysis of the MHR-PCM system with and without metal foam is performed, and the results show a significant improvement in performance with the PCM having metal foam embedded in it. The study on the effect of metal foam porosity reveals an interplay between effective PCM thermal conductivity and PCM amount on the hydrogen charging rate. The study clearly illustrates the limitation posed by the MH powder thermal conductivity on heat transfer and optimizes the metal foam morphology for improved hydrogen charging and discharging rates. The natural heat convection in the PCM is found to be negligible due to its high density. A brief study on the influence of hydrogen inlet and exit pressures, and the amount of PCM on charging and discharging rates is also performed. The study provides an in-depth insight into the formation of liquid and mass fraction fronts in the PCM and MH regions, respectively, under different operating conditions and PCM configurations. © 2020},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is regarded as the promising energy carrier in the 21st century and high-pressure storage is selected as the best option. However, spontaneous ignition would be induced if high-pressure hydrogen is suddenly released. Three cases were numerically conducted to gain an insight into the mechanism of the spontaneous ignition and to validate against our previous experimental results. Result show that a hemispherical shock wave is first produced. Then it is reflected as reflected shock wave after hitting the tube wall and interacts with other reflected shock waves to form the Mach disk, shock triple point and a barrel shock. The height of the Mach disk gradually decreases and finally it disappears. Meanwhile, the shape of hydrogen jet changes from a forward convex shape to a backward concave shape and hydrogen/air mixture layer is formed near the tube wall and the center of the tube. The temperature of the shock-affected region gradually increases and its area thickens. After maintenance of high temperature for a period of time, spontaneous ignition firstly occurs at the tube boundary. Present numerical results not only reproduce the ignition conditions but also the ignition positions indicating that the model is an effective tool for hydrogen safety engineering. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Innovative renewable routes are potentially able to sustain the transition to a decarbonized energy economy. Green synthetic fuels, including hydrogen and natural gas, are considered viable alternatives to fossil fuels. Indeed, they play a fundamental role in those sectors that are di cult to electrify (e.g., road mobility or high-heat industrial processes), are capable of mitigating problems related to flexibility and instantaneous balance of the electric grid, are suitable for large-size and long-term storage and can be transported through the gas network. This article is an overview of the overall supply chain, including production, transport, storage and end uses. Available fuel conversion technologies use renewable energy for the catalytic conversion of non-fossil feedstocks into hydrogen and syngas. We will show how relevant technologies involve thermochemical, electrochemical and photochemical processes. The syngas quality can be improved by catalytic CO and CO2 methanation reactions for the generation of synthetic natural gas. Finally, the produced gaseous fuels could follow several pathways for transport and lead to different final uses. Therefore, storage alternatives and gas interchangeability requirements for the safe injection of green fuels in the natural gas network and fuel cells are outlined.

	abstract = {According to new findings, the use of alternative energy sources such as wind energy is needed to supply the energy demand of future generations. On the other hand, combined renewable energy systems can be more efficient than their stand-alone systems. Therefore, clean energy-based hybrid energy systems can be a suitable solution for fossil fuels. However, for their widespread commercialization, more detailed and powerful studies are needed. On the other hand, in order to attain sustainable development for the use of renewable energy sources due to their nature, energy storage is required. The motivation of this study is introduce and examine a new energy system performance for the production of electricity and hydrogen fuel as well as energy storage. So, this paper presents the energy and exergy operation of a hybrid wind turbine, water electrolyzer and Pumped-hydro-compressed air system. The electricity produced by the wind turbine is used to produce hydrogen fuel in electrolyzer and the excess energy is stored using the storage system. It was found that the electrolyzer needed 512.6 W of electricity to generate 5 mol/h of hydrogen fuel, which was supplied by a 10 kW-wind turbine. In such a context, the efficiency of the process was 74.93%. Furthermore, on average, the isothermal process requires 17.53% less storage capacity than the isentropic process. The effect of key parameters such as rate of hydrogen fuel production, operating pressures, wind speed and components efficiency on the process operation is also examined. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen carriers have been actively explored as a viable option for safe and economical hydrogen storage and transportation. However, the highly endothermic nature of dehydrogenation reactions results in a considerable temperature nonuniformity due to severe heat transfer limitations. To address this issue, a bench-scale catalytic reactor for hydrogen production is developed from methanol steam reforming (MSR) using a liquid-gas organic phase change material (PCM) working at a medium temperature range (200°C-300°C) and near-ambient pressure conditions. First, a comparative study was conducted to quantify the temperature homogeneities with or without adopting PCM; the former showed a higher temperature uniformity, leading to an improved hydrogen production rate and system efficiency. Additionally, a rapid start-up and uniform temperature profile of the catalytic bed at a steady state by the thermal management of the PCM were manifested. The liquid-gas organic PCM was stable during MSR at 250°C, despite minor oxidation. For the feasibility study on a bench scale, 0.6 kWe-level hydrogen generation (equivalent to 5.83 kWe/Lreactor) using the PCM-based reactor was demonstrated. This work can provide insights into the scale-up and thermal management of various catalytic dehydrogenation reactors encompassing considerable heat absorption or release. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {It is now well established that electrochemical systems can optimally perform only within a narrow range of temperature. Exposure to temperatures outside this range adversely affects the performance and lifetime of these systems. As a result, thermal management is an essential consideration during the design and operation of electrochemical equipment and, can heavily influence the success of electrochemical energy technologies. Recently, significant attempts have been placed on the maturity of cooling technologies for electrochemical devices. Nonetheless, the existing reviews on the subject have been primarily focused on battery cooling. Conversely, heat transfer in other electrochemical systems commonly used for energy conversion and storage has not been subjected to critical reviews. To address this issue, the current study gives an overview of the progress and challenges on the thermal management of different electrochemical energy devices including fuel cells, electrolysers and supercapacitors.

	abstract = {The production of hydrogen from renewable energy and its conversion to other valuable fuels, for example methanol, could help to mitigate the negative effect of CO2 emissions on the environment and compensate for the intermittency of renewable energy sources. This paper is focused on the conceptual design and analysis of an integrated energy system for the production and use of renewable methanol, which is a promising way to recycle CO2 avoiding the release of emissions into the atmosphere. Methanol is obtained through the hydrogenation of captured and recycled CO2, using hydrogen produced from renewable energy in a high temperature reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC). Such a system, connected to a micro-grid, can fulfil the electrical load profile and provide methanol as an easy-to-store fuel and chemical feedstock. Indeed, the RSOC can operate in electrolysis cell (SOEC) mode when an excess of renewable energy is available, producing hydrogen and methanol in the methanol synthesis section (MSS). Methanol is stored in the liquid phase and subsequently converted into electricity, by operating the RSOC in fuel cell mode (SOFC) when there is a lack of renewable energy. Therefore, this system represents an interesting solution to provide ancillary services within a smart grid framework. A thermal energy storage (TES) system of latent heat type based on a suitable phase change material (PCM) was also included to recover and store heat released by the SOFC, to be recycled later in order to satisfy the thermal energy requirements of both SOEC (steam production) and MSS (distillation column reboiler). Comprehensive electrochemical models of RSOC, in both SOEC and SOFC operating modes, were specifically developed. A kinetic model was also developed to simulate the methanol synthesis process. These models were used to predict the performance of the main system components (RSOC in SOEC and SOFC modes, MSS) and the overall system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, recent development in hydrogen-based transportation engines is reviewed to scrutinize the feasibility of using hydrogen as a major fuel of future. Using hydrogen in internal combustion engines achieves only 20-25% efficiency and low power output compared to fossil-fueled internal combustion engines. Although hydrogen-based internal combustion engines have recently received considerable interests, several practical barriers have prevented the fast development of this technology. Hence, at the current stage, using hydrogen as an additive to hydrocarbon fuel systems have been taken into consideration to produce higher performance than hydrogen-only internal combustion engines. Using the dual-fuel strategy can increase the combustion stability and thermal efficiency while decreasing the CO and unburned hydrocarbons emissions, and fuel consumption. Alternatively, hydrogen can be used in fuel cells for vehicular applications with several automotive manufacturers producing fuel cell vehicles currently. Fuel cells can achieve efficiencies of up to 60%, while the rest is lost as heat. Strategies that have been investigated to increase the efficiency, performance, and lifespan of fuel cells are capillary pumping systems, a chemisorption chiller, nanofluids and supercapacitors. All such strategies improved the fuel cells in one or more ways. Safety, hydrogen delivery, onboard storage, and the capital and operating costs of hydrogen powered vehicles are analyzed to approach to clean transportation utopia. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Due to its capability to produce negative CO2 emissions, bioenergy in combination with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been identified as a key technology to limit global warming and to support the energy transition in pursue of the climate targets of this century. Among different bioenergy applications, advanced liquid biofuels produced through the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste biomass have gained interest as promising drop-in alternatives to fossil fuels. However, there is lack of studies in literature that evaluate the potential of HTL as negative emission technology in the context of BECCS and present detailed process design of such an implementation for different types of biomass. In this paper, we perform carbon capture modeling based on state-of-art experimental data on HTL of waste lignocellulosic and urban biomasses by means of physical absorption via the Selexol™ process. The process model is utilized for developing a techno-economic analysis that highlights key parameters to optimize CO2 capture cost efficiency. The results indicate that the purity of the CO2 product fulfils the requirements for geological storage in all cases studied, and is on-spec for pipeline transportation when the composition of C2+ hydrocarbons and H2S in the HTL gas are kept below 4 and 1 mol % respectively, or by the implementation of two absorption steps. For the standard process evaluated, the estimated cost of the captured CO2 is between 40 and 53 EUR/tonne, which is in the range of the carbon price expected within this decade in the EU emission trading system, given the announced cap reductions until 2030 and the targets set by the European Green Deal. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Thermal management of metal hydride (MH) hydrogen storage systems is critically important to maintain the hydrogen absorption and release rates at desired levels. Implementing thermal management arrangements introduces challenges at system level mostly related to system's overall mass, volume, energy efficiency, complexity and maintenance, long-term durability, and cost. Low effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of the MH bed (~0.1–0.3 W/mK) is a well-known challenge for effective implementation of different thermal management techniques. This paper comprehensively reviews thermal management solutions for the MH hydrogen storage used in fuel cell systems by also focusing on heat transfer enhancement techniques and assessment of heat sources used for this purpose. The literature recommended that the ETC of the MH bed should be greater than 2 W/mK, and heat transfer coefficient with heating/cooling media should be in the range of 1000–1200 W/m2K to achieve desired MH's performance. Furthermore, alternative heat sources such as fuel cell heat recovery or capturing MH heat during charging and releasing it back during discharging have also been thoroughly reviewed here. Finally, this review paper highlights the gaps and suggests directions accordingly for future research on thermal management for MH systems. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {A low-cost lumped parameter model (LPM) is developed to simulate hydrogen storage in solid-state materials. The proposed LPM is a zero-dimensional model based on an analogous transient thermal resistance network that considers the whole storage system as a resistor–capacitor (RC) circuit with a current source. Combined with the mass conservation, sorption kinetics, and equation of state, the LPM is capable of predicting key thermofluidic quantities of the storage system, such as the storage bed temperature and pressure, hydrogen fraction and flowrate, and storage tank temperature. To test the applicability of the LPM, chemisorptive (Mg and LaNi5) and physisorptive (activated carbon) solid-state materials are simulated for adsorption and desorption processes. For both material types, LPM achieves predictive accuracies comparable to three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, especially for hydrogen fraction and storage times (with maximum errors less than 9.6%), for a fraction of the computational cost (23,734 times lower memory requirement and 126 times faster calculation time). In addition, several formulations of the bed thermal resistance are proposed and discussed in terms of their impact on the accuracy of the LPM predictions. For slender cylindrical tanks, an equivalent annulus formula achieves the best balance of simplicity and accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Increasing the penetration of renewables-based power generation such as from wind and solar is key to curbing greenhouse emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels. As the capacity of solar and wind installations increase, the highly dynamic nature of renewable generation leads to frequent energy curtailment in instances when the total generation exceeds the load. Presently, we analyze data from ERCOT (which manages the primary electric grid in Texas), to study potential storage of excess wind and solar energy via electrolysis-driven conversion to hydrogen (green hydrogen). This stored hydrogen could be converted back to electricity and fed into the grid whenever there is an energy deficit. In this study, we characterize a long-duration storage system (based on estimated capacity increases by 2025) in terms of storage size, rated power and the costs involved in generating H2 via electrolysis. Our analysis reveals the need for long-duration storage in two periods: i) mid-March to June, and ii) mid-October to December. During these periods, the surplus energy generated and stored in the form of green hydrogen would be self-sufficient to provide the deficit energy for instances when generation from renewables cannot meet load requirements. Minimum storage capacities of 10, 000 3500 GWh would be required for these periods to avoid curtailment. Preliminary techno-economic analysis suggests that total electrolyzer capacity of ∼ 40 GW would be required to avoid significant curtailment. Any added capital cost beyond this rating would not yield significant returns on investment as hydrogen production would have reached its peak capacity. Furthermore, the cost for producing hydrogen via electrolysis ($2-4) for electrolyzers at such capacity would be competitive with existing steam reforming technologies. Overall, the proposed long-duration storage system can increase the contribution of renewables to the Texas grid by 16%. The analysis and insights obtained from this study can serve as a benchmark and seed future studies in planning and designing long-duration storage systems based on the estimated capacity increase in renewables. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In light of advancing climate change, environmentally-friendly methods for generating renewable energy are being employed to an increasing extent. This use, however, leads to rising spatial and temporal disbalances between electricity generation and consumption. To address the associated challenges, Power-to-X technologies are considered to harness surplus electricity from renewable sources and convert it into an alternative energy source that can be utilized, transported and stored. The aim of this paper is to compare four different Power-to-X technologies, whereby surplus electricity “Power” is converted to chemical entities “X”. It is shown that the implementation of PtX technologies and a shift of energy distribution to other transport methods could significantly relieve the electricity grid. Moreover, by converting the electricity from renewable sources, like wind farms, into chemical energy sources, the PtX concept offers the opportunity of making larger quantities of energy storable over longer periods of time. By considering a model case where electricity generation and consumption are several hundred kilometres apart, the generation of fuels emerges as a technology with the highest potential to mitigate climate change. Also with regard to transport, fuels emerge as the most favourable option for transporting chemically bound energy. Common to all options is the yield of a significant stream of oxygen as by-product. Utilizing this oxygen may be one of the key factors towards improving the economic viability of Power-to-X technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Thermal stratification of cryogenic propellants under the condition of external heat leakage is a dominating factor pressurizing the storage tank, which hinders long-term on-orbit storage missions for future explorations. Whether a thermodynamic venting system or cryocooler is introduced to reduce the boil-off losses or even realize zero boil-off of the cryogens, an efficient mixing and heat-exchanging device is a prerequisite for eliminating thermal stratification. Usually, a subcooled stream is introduced, which is injected into the tank through the nozzles on a spray bar. Early research provided evidence that the cooling effect is related to the arrangement of the nozzles. In contrast to adopting a heavy plate spray bar to realize the temperature profile symmetry along the tank axis, this study proposes an assembly with a rotatable nozzle head to diminish the temperature non-uniformity in the tank. In this manner, over 70% of the spray bar payload can be saved compared to the plate configuration. A three-dimensional model was established to investigate the temperature distribution of liquid hydrogen at zero gravity in a tank containing such a rotatable sprayer, which was passively driven by the counterforce of the injection flow, and therefore excluded an extra power drive demand. The injection inlet velocity, as well as the length and quantity of the nozzle arms, were analyzed parametrically to optimize the destratification performance. By employing the self-spinning sprayer, the standard deviation of the temperature in the tank could be lowered, along with the benefits of a significant payload reduction and elimination of direct power input. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Extending CN self-Assembly into multiphase polymer structures has led to useful end-results in a wide spectrum of products and countless innovative applications, for example, as reinforcing agent, emulsion stabilizer, barrier membrane and binder. In the current contribution, after a brief description of salient nanocellulose chemical structure features, its types and production methods, we move to recent advances in CN utilization as an ecofriendly binder in several disparate areas, namely formaldehyde-free hybrid composites and wood-based panels, papermaking/coating processes, and energy storage devices, as well as their potential applications in biomedical fields as a cost-effective and tissue-friendly binder for cartilage regeneration, wound healing and dental repair. The prospects of a wide range of hybrid materials that may be produced via nanocellulose is introduced in light of the unique behavior of cellulose once in nano dimensions. Furthermore, we implement some principles of colloidal and interfacial science to discuss the critical role of cellulose binding in the aforesaid fields. Even though the CN facets covered in this study by no means encompass the great amount of literature available, they may be regarded as the basis for future developments in the binder applications of these highly desirable materials. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Carbon nanotubes are unique tubular structures of nanometer diameter and large length/diameter ratio. The nanotubes may consist of one up to tens and hundreds of concentric shells of carbons with adjacent shells separation of ∼0.34nm. The carbon network of the shells is closely related to the honeycomb arrangement of the carbon atoms in the graphite sheets. The amazing mechanical and electronic properties of the nanotubes stem in their quasi-one-dimensional (1D) structure and the graphite-like arrangement of the carbon atoms in the shells. Thus, the nanotubes have high Young's modulus and tensile strength, which makes them preferable for composite materials with improved mechanical properties. The nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on their structural parameters. This opens the ways for application of the nanotubes as central elements in electronic devices including field-effect transistors (FET), single-electron transistors and rectifying diodes. Possibilities for using of the nanotubes as high-capacity hydrogen storage media were also considered.

Hybrid battery-hydrogen storage system was found to be more cost competitive with unit cost of electricity at $0.626/kWh (US dollar) compared to battery-only energy storage systems with a $2.68/kWh unit cost of electricity. This research also found that the excess stored hydrogen can be further utilised to generate extra electricity. Further utilisation of generated electricity can be incorporated to meet the load demand by either decreasing the base load supply from gas in the present scenario or exporting it to neighbouring states to enhance economic viability of the system. The use of excess stored hydrogen to generate extra electricity further reduced the cost to $0.494/kWh. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of porous, crystalline materials with applications in the capture, storage, and separation of gasses. Although much effort has been devoted to understanding the properties of MOFs in powder form, in a realistic system the MOF media will likely be employed as dense compacts, such as pucks or pellets, to maximize volumetric efficiency. In these applications efficient transport of the heat of adsorption/desorption is an important design consideration. Consequently, densified composites consisting of a physical mixture of a MOF and expanded natural graphite (ENG) have been proposed as a means to enhance the intrinsically low thermal conductivity of these materials. Here we demonstrate that the high-aspect ratio of ENG particles, combined with uni-axial compression, results in anisotropic microstructural and thermal transport properties in composite MOF-5/ENG pellets. Microscopy of pellet cross-sections revealed a textured microstructure with MOF particle boundaries and ENG orientations aligned perpendicular to the pressing direction. This anisotropy is manifested in the thermal conductivity, which is two to four times higher in directions perpendicular to the pressing direction. We further demonstrate that this anisotropy can be exploited using two processing techniques. First, a custom die and densification process allows for reorientation of the preferred heat flow pathway. Second, a layered MOF-5/ENG microstructure increases the thermal conductivity by an order of magnitude, with only minor ENG additions (5 wt.%). These results reveal that anisotropic thermal transport in MOF composites can be tailored using a judicious combination of second phase additions and processing techniques. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This data is relevant to the safety scenario of a sudden leak in a high-pressure hydrogen containment vessel and will provide a technological basis for determining hazardous length scales associated with unintended hydrogen releases at storage and distribution centers. Jet flames originating from high-pressure sources up to 413 bar (6000 psi) were studied to verify the application of correlations and scaling laws based on lower-pressure subsonic and choked-flow jet flames. These higher pressures are expected to be typical of the pressure ranges in future hydrogen storage vessels. At these pressures the flows exiting the jet nozzle are categorized as underexpanded jets in which the flow is choked at the jet exit. Additionally, the gas behavior departs from that of an ideal-gas and alternate formulations for non-ideal gas must be introduced. Visible flame emission was recorded on video to evaluate flame length and structure. Radiometer measurements allowed determination of the radiant heat flux characteristics. The flame length results show that lower-pressure engineering correlations, based on the Froude number and a non-dimensional flame length, also apply to releases up to 413 bar (6000 psi). Similarly, radiative heat flux characteristics of these high-pressure jet flames obey scaling laws developed for low-pressure, smaller-scale flames and a wide variety of fuels. The results verify that such correlations can be used to a priori predict dimensional characteristics and radiative heat flux from a wide variety of hydrogen-jet flames resulting from accidental releases.},

	abstract = {Efficient storage of cryogenic propellants in zero-gravity or microgravity environments is one of the key requirements to enable new long-range space exploration missions currently envisioned by NASA. Recent advances in multi-layer insulation (MLI) allow to sharply reduce the heat leak into cryogenic propellant storage tanks through the tank surface and, as a consequence, significantly extend the storage duration. In this situation the MLI penetrations, such as support struts, feed lines, etc., become significant challenges of the tank's heat management. This problem is especially acute for liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage, since currently no efficient cryocoolers exist mat operate at very low LH2 temperatures (∼20K). In the absence of active cooling the heat leaks through the MLI penetrations will inevitably cause the onset of localized boiling at the tank walls. Our estimates show that for realistic values of local heat inflow the rate by which vapor bubbles are generated near the penetrations will exceed by one or several orders of magnitude the rate of bubble collapse in the subcooled liquid. Therefore, with time vapor bubbles may accumulate within the liquid and drift towards the stagnation areas of the liquid flow in the presence of mixers. Thus, even small heat leaks under microgravity conditions and over the period of many months may give rise to a complex slowly-developing, large-scale spatiotemporal physical phenomena in a multi-phase liquid-vapor mixture. These phenomena are not well-understood nor can be easily controlled. They can be of a potentially hazardous nature for long-term on-orbital cryogenic storage, propellant loading, tank chilldown, engine restart, and other in-space cryogenic fluid management operations. We performed some basic physical estimates to evaluate the relative importance of different physical processes during long-term cryogenic storage of LH2. Our main goal was to identify the processes and issues, such as safety hazards and design optimization parameters, which arise specifically during extended periods in zero- and microgravity. The next step in developing a better physical understanding of long-term cryogenic storage systems and finding new engineering design solutions is to obtain new fundamental data from on-orbit cryogenic storage experiments. We propose a conceptual design for an ISS-based medium-scale cryogenic storage tank experiment that would probe vapor bubble formation, growth, motion, coalescence and collapse in the presence of localized heat sources in a microgravity environment in the presence of stirring jets of different configurations and passive cooling devices such as MLI, thermodynamic vent system, and vapor-cooled shield.},

	abstract = {Mg-based metal hydride has been viewed as one of the most promising materials for hydrogen storage. However, large amount of reaction heat during the hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles negatively affects the heat and mass transfer, thus leading to poor performances. In this work, helical coil heat exchanger (HCHE) is proposed to be inserted into Mg-based metal hydride reactor for improving the heat and mass transfer. The models on pressure-composition-temperature properties and hydrogen desorption kinetics of Mg-based reactor are firstly established for the simulation through experiments. The comparison of hydrogen desorption performances for the reactors incorporating the conventional straight tube, finned tube and new helical coil heat exchangers is conducted based on numerical simulation. The comparison results show that the HCHE has the best effects on improving the heat and mass transfer characteristics of reactor among the three heat exchangers, due to its secondary circulation. Besides, it is suggested that the influence of hydrogen pressure gradient should be considered for the prediction of the performance of Mg-based metal hydride reactor with HCHE. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

High utilization rates of electrolysers are necessary to reach profitability. A need for massive storage begins for a renewable penetration rate of 50%.

	abstract = {A two-dimensional mathematical model to predict the thermal performance of an adiabatic hydrogen storage system based on the combination of magnesium hydride and magnesium hydroxide materials has been developed. A simple geometry consisting of two coaxial cylinders filled with the hydrogen and thermochemical heat storage materials was considered. The main objective was to gain a better knowledge on the thermal interaction between the two storage media, and to determine the dependence of the hydrogen absorption time on the geometric characteristics of the reactor as well as the operation conditions and the thermophysical properties of the selected materials. The dimensions of the two compartments where the two materials are filled were chosen based on the results of a preliminary analytical study in order to compare the absorption times obtained analytically and numerically. The numerical results have shown that the hydrogen absorption process can be completed in a shorter interval of time than analytically as a result of the larger temperature gradient between the magnesium hydride and magnesium hydroxide beds. This was mainly due to variation of temperature in the thermochemical heat storage material during the more realistic dehydration reaction in the numerical solution. Larger temperature gradients, thus a faster hydrogen absorption process can also be achieved by increasing the hydrogen absorption pressure. Moreover, it was found that the increase of the thermal conductivity of the magnesium hydroxide material is crucial for a further improvement of the performance of the MgH2–Mg(OH)2 combination reactor. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The prediction of the radiative heat flux from a turbulent-jet flame issuing from a damaged, high-pressure hydrogen storage system is an issue of importance for the safe use of hydrogen. Information about the variation of the thermal radiation exposure with distance from the hydrogen jet flame as well as the length and duration of the flame is important in determining safe distances for the handling and storage of hydrogen. An equally important issue is the determination of the concentration decay of an unignited hydrogen jet in the surrounding air, and the envelope of locations where the concentration falls below the lower flammability limit for hydrogen. This paper discusses and presents results from models for the radiative heat transfer from hydrogen jet flames and the concentration decay of unignited hydrogen jets for unintended release events involving high-pressure gas storage systems and fuel dispensers. The models are based on a combination of empirical correlations and analytical models, as well as a numerical model of the temporal blow-down of a hydrogen storage tank. For hydrogen jet flames, predictions of the radiative heat flux are shown and compared to exposure limits documented in the literature. For unignited hydrogen jets, concentration contours are presented and the distance to the lower flammability limit is computed. Comparisons are made with natural gas leaks from tanks at the same pressure with the same effective leak area. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {Power-to-gas is a key area of interest for decarbonisation and increasing flexibility in energy systems, as it has the potential both to absorb renewable electricity at times of excess supply and to provide backup energy at times of excess demand. By integrating power-to-gas with the natural gas grid, it is possible to exploit the inherent linepack flexibility of the grid, and shift some electricity variability onto the gas grid. Furthermore, provided the gas injected into the gas grid is low-carbon, such as hydrogen from renewable power-to-gas, then overall greenhouse gas emissions from the gas grid can be reduced. This work presents the first review of power-to-gas to consider real-life projects, economic assessments and systems modelling studies, and to compare them based on scope, assumptions and outcomes. The review focuses on power-to-gas for injection into the gas grid, as this application has specific economic, technical and modelling opportunities and challenges. The review identified significant interest in, and potential for, power-to-gas in combination with the gas grid, however there are still challenges to overcome to find profitable business cases and manage local and system-wide technical issues. Whilst significant modelling of power-to-gas has been undertaken, more is needed to fully understand the impacts of power-to-gas and gas grid injection on the operational behaviour of the gas grid, taking into account dynamic and spatial effects. © 2018 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage in liquid state is considered key feature to its efficient volumetric density for transportation applications. However, there are several hazards associated with handling liquid hydrogen, e.g. fire, explosion, asphyxiation in indoor accidents, and frostbites due to exposure in extremely low temperatures. Predictive capabilities of liquid hydrogen dispersion are essential for developing emergency response plans and facilitate the understanding of the physical problem. In the present study, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methodology is employed to simulate the dispersion of liquid hydrogen based on experiment conducted by the Health Safety Laboratory (HSL), in order to investigate several factors that greatly influence dispersion modeling. The flashed vapour fraction at the pipe exit is estimated assuming isenthalpic expansion combined with the NIST equation of state. Modeling the condensation of ambient humidity and air components (nitrogen and oxygen) and imposing transient wind profile are the main issues addressed by the present study. The Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM model) is compared against the Non-Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (NHEM model) to account for slip effects of the non-vapour phase. To estimate the slip velocity in the NHEM model a methodology (momentum slip model) is employed, which solves along with the conservation equations for the mixture the momentum conservation equation of the non-vapour phase. Comparison of the momentum slip model with the algebraic slip model shows that the latter overestimates the slip velocity for large particles and thus its use needs special attention. Overall satisfactory agreement was found with the experimental data when all the above parameters were modelled. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Electrochemical systems, such as fuel cell and water splitting devices, represent some of the most efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for energy conversion and storage. Electrocatalysts play key roles in the chemical processes but often limit the performance of the entire systems due to insufficient activity, lifetime, or high cost. It has been a long-standing challenge to develop efficient and durable electrocatalysts at low cost. In this Perspective, we present our recent efforts in developing strongly coupled inorganic/nanocarbon hybrid materials to improve the electrocatalytic activities and stability of inorganic metal oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, and metal-nitrogen complexes. The hybrid materials are synthesized by direct nucleation, growth, and anchoring of inorganic nanomaterials on the functional groups of oxidized nanocarbon substrates including graphene and carbon nanotubes. This approach affords strong chemical attachment and electrical coupling between the electrocatalytic nanoparticles and nanocarbon, leading to nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts with improved activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction for fuel cells and chlor-alkali catalysis, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. X-ray absorption near-edge structure and scanning transmission electron microscopy are employed to characterize the hybrids materials and reveal the coupling effects between inorganic nanomaterials and nanocarbon substrates. Z-contrast imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy at single atom level are performed to investigate the nature of catalytic sites on ultrathin graphene sheets. Nanocarbon-based hybrid materials may present new opportunities for the development of electrocatalysts meeting the requirements of activity, durability, and cost for large-scale electrochemical applications. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Restrictions to the validity of particular results are also evaluated. Major attention is here given to metal hydride storage tanks for light duty vehicles, since this application is the most promising one for such storage materials and has been widely studied in the literature. Enhancing cooling/heating during hydrogen uptake and discharge has found to be essential to improve storage systems capacities and minimize time requirements. Various fueling strategies are widely explained differing by the particular system approach taken into account.

Thermochemical energy storage materials have the advantage of much higher energy densities than latent or sensible heat materials. Furthermore, thermochemical energy storage systems based on metal hydrides have been gaining great interest for having the advantage of higher energy densities, better reversibility, and high enthalpies. However, in order to achieve higher efficiencies desired of a thermal storage system by the US Department of Energy, the system is required to operate at temperatures >600 °C. Operation at temperatures >600 °C presents challenges including material selection, hydrogen embrittlement and permeation of containment vessels, appropriate selection of heat transfer fluids, and cost.

	abstract = {The surface of nuclear waste container will be completely wetted by the groundwater infiltrating through the bentonite or concrete buffer after the closure of its deep geological disposal. Because of its excellent corrosion resistance, titanium is one of the candidates for the container materials for high-level nuclear waste (HLNW) disposal. However, once oxygen depleted in the large time scale deep geological disposal, titanium container will suffer from hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Therefore, in order to predict the potential danger of the HLNW container caused by HE, the hydrogen entry into titanium was studied at different temperatures in simulated deep geological environment of Beishan, which is the preselected HLNW disposal area in China. Devanathan-Stachurski cell methods were firstly implemented in measuring apparent hydrogen diffusivity in titanium with hydrides being formed during hydrogen charging at low temperature ranges (298–373 K). Given the characteristic of the Devanathan-Stachurski cell method's capable of getting apparent diffusivity with combined influencing factors easily, the technique provides a simple way to measure the parameter that is necessary for the estimation of hydrogen penetration depth, facilitating the design of HLNW containers. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {High temperature metal hydrides used for storing hydrogen have promising future prospect due to the interesting density that characterizes it. This type of hydride offers high hydrogen storage capacities and its formation is highly exothermic. Therefore, the formation enthalpy represents 30% of the lower heating value (LHV) of the absorbed hydrogen, which represents a significant energy cost. This article introduces a numerical study of a new cylindrical conception of a high temperature metal-hydrogen reactor (MHR) integrating a phase change material (PCM). This system was developed to store efficiently the realized heat during hydrogen absorption process in order to recover it during desorption. A mathematical model was developed in two-dimensional (2D) and solved using the unstructured control volume finite element method (CVFEM). For this model, the proposed expressions of the reaction kinetic and the equilibrium pressure of the hydride system (Mg2NiH4) [1] and the analytic approximation based on the Heaviside step function [2] to describe the liquid fraction were used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the reactor during desorption process. Numerical results showed that the new composition Mg69Zn28Al3, which investigated by Garrier et al. [3] is the appropriate PCM that met the requirements to store the exothermic released heat for our hydride system.

	abstract = {We must soon "run the world on renewables" but cannot, and should not try to, accomplish this entirely with electricity transmission. We need to supply all energy, not just electricity, from diverse renewable energy (RE) resources, both distributed and centralized, where the world's richest RE resources - of large geographic extent and high intensity - are stranded: far from end-users with inadequate or nonexistent gathering and transmission systems to deliver the energy. Electricity energy storage cannot affordably firm large, intermittent renewables at annual scale, while carbon-free gaseous hydrogen (GH2) and liquid anhydrous ammonia (NH3) fuels can: GH2 in large solution-mined salt caverns, NH3 in surface tanks, both pressurized and refrigerated. "Smart Grid" is emerging as primarily a DSM (demand side management) strategy to encourage energy conservation. Making the electricity grid "smarter" does not: 1. Increase physical transmission capacity; 2. Provide affordable annual-scale firming storage for RE; 3. Solve grid integration problem for large, time-varying RE; 4. Alleviate NIMBY objections to new transmission siting; 5. Reduce the high O&M costs of overhead electric lines. The "smarter" grid may be more vulnerable to cyberattack. Adding storage, control, and quality adjunct devices to the electricity grid, to accommodate very high renewables content, may be technically and economically inferior to GH2 and NH3 RE systems. Thus, we need to look beyond "smart grid", expanding our concept of "transmission", to synergistically and simultaneously solve the transmission, firming storage, and RE integration "balancing" problems now severely constraining our progress toward "running the world on renewables".

To minimize the losses, complicated insulation techniques are necessary. In general, Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) and a Vapor-Cooled Shield (VCS) are used together in LH2 tanks. In the design of an LH2 tank with VCS, the main goal is to find the optimum location for the VCS in order to minimize heat leakage. In this study, a 2D thermal model is developed by considering the temperature dependencies of the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of hydrogen gas. The developed model is used to analyze the effects of model considerations on heat leakage predictions. Furthermore, heat leakage in insulation of LH2 tanks with single and double VCS is analyzed for an automobile application, and the optimum locations of the VCS for minimization of heat leakage are determined for both cases. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

In order to avoid the venting during the liquid hydrogen storage and decrease energy loss in space application, this paper presents a numerical study of the thermal performance of a hydrogen storage tank with nozzle injection and its improvement - a guide tube. Compared with the previous storage tank without guide tube, the chilling performance of the new storage system is enhanced since the guide tube improves the heat transfer and reduces the stagnant region to meliorate the flow circulation. Distribution profiles of temperature and velocity in the storage tank have been attained to evaluate the chilling performance. The key geometric parameters are further optimized by analyzing a series of cases under different geometry settings, from which the optimized ranges of dimensionless parameters have been obtained and studied respectively. This research provides guidelines for geometrical optimization of the liquid hydrogen cryogenic storage tank, and it helps to improve the chilling performance of the storage tank and promote the utilization of hydrogen energy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

In such a concept, the heat of reaction released during the absorption of hydrogen is stored by a thermochemical material in order to be reused in a subsequent desorption stage. Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) has been selected as the suitable material for integration into the MgH2 storage system due to its thermodynamic properties. An analytical formulation of hydrogen absorption time is used to determine the range of the geometrical characteristics of the two storage media, their properties and their operating conditions. The advantage of the proposed new concept is the possibility to reduce the mass of the heat storage media by a factor of 4 compared to phase change material, improving then the gravimetric system capacity as well as its total cost. The second advantage is an improved flexibility of the operating pressure conditions for MgH2 absorption reaction and Mg(OH)2 dehydration reaction that enables shorter hydrogen absorption times by ensuring larger temperature gradients between the two storage media. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Earth's richest renewable energy resources - large in geographic extent, high intensity - are usually stranded: far from end-users without gathering and transmission systems. The output of most renewables varies greatly, at time scales of seconds to seasons: the energy capture assets thus operate at inherently low capacity factor (CF), and energy delivery is not 'firm'. New electric transmission systems dedicated to renewables will suffer the same low CF and represent substantial stranded capital assets. At gigawatt (GW) scale, renewable-source electricity could be converted to hydrogen and oxygen, via high-pressure-output electrolyzers. Hydrogen would be pipelined to load centers for use as vehicle fuel, retail-value combined-heat-and-power generation on the customers' side of meters, ammonia production, and refinery feedstock. Great Plains, U.S.A. wind energy alone, if fully harvested and pipelined to markets, could supply all U.S.A. energy. About 15 000 new, large, solution-mined Great Plains salt caverns could economically store enough energy as compressed hydrogen to 'firm' this wind power at annual scale, at an incremental capital cost to the generation-transmission system of 5-10%. Worldwide firming in geologic formations adds great market and strategic value to diverse, stranded, and abundant renewables. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is expected to be highly valuable energy carrier for the 21th century as it should participate in answering main society and economical concerns. To exploit the benefits of this energy at large scale, further research and technological developments are required in order to secure its storage, especially during fire exposure. Thus, studies on the mechanical and the thermal behaviours of the composite used in the manufacture of tanks for the storage of hydrogen are important. At present, the use of epoxy/carbon fibre composites is developed widely because of its low weight and its good mechanical properties. Thus, the present study focusses on the thermal degradation property and the influence of a fire or a heating source on the residual mechanical behaviour of such materials. To account for this point, an experimental study is introduced in order to improve the understanding of thermal degradation and fire exposure mechanisms of composite using different “elementary” samples (±12°, ±45°, 90° and quasi-isotropic samples). Firstly, to characterize the mechanical properties versus temperature, tensile tests are performed on samples submitted in situ to 4 homogeneous temperature conditions up to 150°C. Secondly, to characterize the mechanical properties versus fire exposure, a thermal degradation is performed using a cone calorimeter (ISO 5660) on carbon/epoxy composite samples. These tests are led for various heat flux values and are stopped at different characteristic times. The other thermal parameters under consideration are the density of energy, the presence (or not) and the duration of the inflammation. Then, the mechanical properties are characterized using tensile test on samples submitted at first to different fire time exposure. The evolution of the elastic properties and ultimate stress show that the density of energy is the main factor leading to a change of the mechanical properties and char thickness evolution. © 2015 International Committee on Composite Materials.

	abstract = {Demands for space and water heating constitute a significant proportion of the total energy demands in Great Britain and are predominantly satisfied through natural gas, which makes the heat sector a large emitter of carbon dioxide. Renewable hydrogen, which can be injected into the gas grid or used directly in processes for generating heat and/or electricity, is being considered as a low-carbon alternative energy carrier to natural gas because of its suitability for large-scale, long- and short-term storage and low transportation losses, all of which help to overcome the intermittency and seasonal variations in renewables. This requires new infrastructures for production, storage, transport and utilisation of renewable hydrogen – a hydrogen value chain – the design of which involves many interdependent decisions, such as: where to locate wind turbines; where to locate electrolysers, close to wind generation or close to demands; whether to transport energy as electricity or hydrogen, and how; where to locate storage facilities; etc. This paper presents the Value Web Model, a novel and comprehensive spatio-temporal mixed-integer linear programming model that can simultaneously optimise the design, planning and operation of integrated energy value chains, accounting for short-term dynamics, inter-seasonal storage and investments out to 2050. It was coupled with GIS modelling to identify candidate sites for wind generation and used to optimise a number of scenarios for the production of hydrogen, from onshore and offshore wind turbines, in order to satisfy heat demands. The results show that over a wide range of scenarios, the optimal pathway to heat is roughly 20% hydrogen and 80% electricity.

	abstract = {Heat transfer is a critical factor affecting the performance of metal hydrogen storage tanks. Many studies have proposed inner tubular heat exchangers for increasing the heat transfer rate between the metal powders and the exterior environment of the tanks. However, connecting cooling and heating fluid tubes to the storage tanks can be a tedious task, especially for large-scale hydrogen storage systems with a large array of tanks. This study presents a novel design for a metal hydride vessel equipped with heat pipes. These heat pipes enhance heat transfer for hydrogen charge and discharge without the need for tubing through the metal bed. This study experimentally demonstrates the effects of using heat pipes to enhance heat transfer in a hydrogen storage tank using LaNi5 as the storage media and comparing tanks with and without heat pipes. Results show that heat pipes can enhance the hydrogen storage rates in both absorption and desorption. The absorption time was reduced more than half with a 10atm hydrogen supply pressure, and the desorption time for hydrogen discharge at 1L/min was increased by 44%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The review contains four parts. The first part gives an overview of the existing types of fuel cells and outlines the potential of using metal hydride stores as a source of hydrogen fuel. The second part of the review considers the suitability and optimisation of different metal hydrides based on their energy efficient thermal integration with fuel cells. The performances of metal hydrides are considered from the viewpoint of the reversible heat driven interaction of the metal hydrides with gaseous H2. Efficiencies of hydrogen and heat exchange in hydrogen stores to control H2 charge/discharge flow rates are the focus of the third section of the review and are considered together with metal hydride – fuel cell system integration issues and the corresponding engineering solutions. Finally, the last section of the review describes specific hydrogen-fuelled systems presented in the available reference data. © 2017 Chinese Materials Research Society},

The ML pattern was changed with an increase in the cycle number and the ML sensor could visualize the inner crack. The stress analysis by the finite element method clarified that the ML sensor provided unique equivalent strain distribution associated with stress concentration at the crack tip, i.e. the distance between two points having high equivalent strains was inversely proportional to the crack depth; consequently, the growth behavior of the inner crack was non-destructively quantified with the ML sensor attached on the outer surface. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Mbs are intensely investigated as archetype to investigate structure/function relationship in globular proteins. In this work, the myoglobin from Sciurus vulgaris meridionalis has been for the first time isolated and purified with a high yield and homogeneity. The primary structure characterization has been performed by applying a strategy based on high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Proximal (position 93, α-helix F8) and distal (position 64, α-helix E7) histidinyl residues as well as most of the amino acid residues (i.e., Leu29, Lys45, Thr67, Val68) involved in the autoxidation mechanism are conserved in the squirrel Mb. The structural and dynamical properties of the squirrel Mb have been also deeply investigated by CD, NMR. Furthermore, molecular dynamics studies of Mbs from different species have been performed. In addition, the functional properties of squirrel Mb have been characterized by determining its autoxidation kinetic and thermal stability in comparison with crested porcupine and reindeer Mbs. Interestingly, a higher autoxidation rate was revealed for squirrel Mb with respect to reindeer and crested porcupine Mbs. Even considering the very similar structural fold, molecular dynamics data show a higher conformational mobility of squirrel Mb with respect to reindeer and crested porcupine. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To investigate the safety properties of high-pressure hydrogen discharge or leakage, an under-expanded hydrogen jet flow with a storage pressure of 82 MPa from a small jet orifice with a diameter of 0.2 mm is studied by three-dimensional (3D) numerical calculations. The full 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations are utilized in a domain with a size of about 3 × 3 × 6 m which is discretized by employing an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technology to reduce the number of grid cells. By AMR, the local mesh resolutions can narrowly cover the Taylor microscale lT and direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed. Both the instantaneous and mean hydrogen concentration distributions in the present jet are discussed. The instantaneous concentrations of hydrogen CH on the axis presents significant turbulent pulsating oscillations. The centerline value of the intensity of concentration fluctuation σˆH asymptotically comes to 0.23, which is in a good agreement with the existing experimental results. It substantiates the conclusion that the asymptotic centerline value of σˆH is independent of jet density ratio. The probability distributions function (PDF) of instantaneous axial CH agree approximately with the Gaussian distribution while skewing a little to the higher range. The time averaged hydrogen concentration C¯H along the radial directions can also be described as a Gaussian distribution. The axial C¯H of 82 MPa hydrogen jet tends to obey the distribution discipline approximated with C¯H=4200/(z/θ) where z is the axial distance from the nozzle and θ is the effective ejection diameter, which is consistent with the experimental results. In addition, the hydrogen tip penetration Ztip is found to be in a linear relationship with the square root of jet flow time t. Meanwhile, the jet's velocity half-width LVh approximately gains an linear relation with z which can be expressed as LVh=0.09z. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Over two decades, research in the field of metal hydride based thermal machines has gained immense attention by the researchers of different fields. Because of its capability to store large volume of hydrogen per unit mass at near ambient condition, its utilization has been spread in numerous applications such as energy storage and other biological, chemical, aerospace and nuclear applications. Though there have been several review reports published on metal hydride based hydrogen storage, but the present work is focused on the thermal management issues and worldwide developmental status of various metal hydride based thermal machines such as thermal energy storage, heat upgradation, heat pump, cooling system, and hydrogen purification and compression. With a brief discussion about the basic understanding of metal hydride alloy formation, this paper also covers screening of metal hydride alloys, design considerations and evolution of different reactor geometries for various metal hydride based thermal management systems. The review also addresses the benefit of coupling of a metal hydride based hydrogen energy system with a conventional thermal system in order to a produce hybrid system with much higher performance and almost zero environmental pollution. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The explicit tendency to increase the power generation from stochastic renewable resources forces to look for technological solutions of energy management and storage. In the recent years, the concept of power-to-gas, where the excess energy is converted into hydrogen and/or further methanized into renewable methane, is gaining high popularity among researchers. In this study, we assess the power-to-renewable methane system as the potential technology for power grid balancing. For the assessment, a mathematical model has been developed that assists in understanding of whether a power-to-renewable methane system can be developed in a region with specific installed and planned capacities of wind energy and biogas plants. Considering the varying amount of excess power available for H2 production and the varying biogas quality, the aim of the model is to simulate the system to determine, if wind power generation meets the needs of biogas plants for storing the excess energy in the form of methane via the methanation process. For the case study, the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) have been selected, as the region is characterized by high dependence on fossil energy sources and electricity import. The results show that with the wind power produced in the region it would be possible to increase the average CH4 content in the methanized biogas by up to 48.4%. Yet, even with a positive H2 net production rate, not in all cases the maximum possible quality of the renewable methane would be achieved, as at moments the necessary amount of H2 for methanation would not be readily available, and the reaction would not be possible. Thus, in the region, the wind power capacities would not meet the biogas plant capacities nor now, nor until 2020. For the system's development, two potential pathways are seen as possible for balancing the regions' power grid. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

While many approaches concentrate on the usage of hydrogen from electrolysis with CO2 for the generation of second generation fuels like synthetic natural gas, the presented paper introduces a combination with the Heatpipe Reformer biomass gasification process: This process produces a synthesis gas, which can be fully and directly converted to methane using additional hydrogen produced in an electrolyser. Furthermore, the applied nickel catalyst is able to convert higher hydrocarbons in the syngas, increasing methane yield and resulting in higher process efficiencies and no additional scrubbing for the adaptation of the CHO stoichiometry is necessary. The Heatpipe Reformer also allows pressurized gasification, which is beneficial for a subsequent methanation step. The full process chain including a 100 kW gasifier and a bench scale methanation reactor was operated in a test campaign for approx. 20 h at different pressure levels. This paper presents results from the process of gasification and methanation as well as the conversion of higher hydrocarbons. An energy balance finally evaluates the entire process in terms of efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Within the framework of Low Thrust Cryogenic Propulsion (LTCP) systems, a low-temperature accumulator acting as thermal energy storage tank is an interesting option for cyclical processes under intermittent firings avoiding the use of turbopumps in the cryogenic stages. Thus, liquid propellant (oxygen, hydrogen or methane) can be gasified under a fast transient evaporation process cooling the accumulator. On the other hand, the same accumulator can be heated by solar collectors, electrical heaters or by means of evaporated propellants recovering heat losses from fuel cells. To obtain a very high thermal energy storage density, the thermal energy stored in the accumulator is performed using a Phase Change Material (PCM) rounding the different fluid flow tubes which heat or cool the storage tank during periodical cycles. The energy management due to the mismatch between intermittent firings, together with optimum design based on minimum weight with maximum heat transfer capacity has led to developing a numerical simulation model. Thermal and fluid dynamic behavior of multi-physics phenomena in the accumulator is based on coupling the two-phase flow inside tubes working under cryogenic conditions with sensible and latent heat transfer through the tank. The numerical model is divided into: 1) a one-dimensional and transient resolution of the governing equations (conservation of mass, momentum, and energy) for the fluid flow inside ducts; 2) a multi-dimensional and transient resolution of the governing equations in the region occupied by the PCM, incorporating a turbulence model to solve the convection phenomena involved; and 3) a multidimensional and transient treatment of the thermal conduction equation for the solid tubes. The numerical results are validated by means of an experimental cylindrical accumulator test facility, instrumented with 25 thermocouples around the vertical tube which goes through the tank and four multilevel thermocouples columns at different distances radially far from the vertical tube located at the center. The comparative analysis shows a good agreement between both numerical results and experimental data for a wide range of different working conditions showing detailed phenomena analysis, together with the possibilities of this model for design optimization purposes. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {A review of more than 60 studies (plus more than 65 studies on P2G) on power and energy models based on simulation and optimization was done. Based on these, for power systems with up to 95% renewables, the electricity storage size is found to be below 1.5% of the annual demand (in energy terms). While for 100% renewables energy systems (power, heat, mobility), it can remain below 6% of the annual energy demand. Combination of sectors and diverting the electricity to another sector can play a large role in reducing the storage size. From the potential alternatives to satisfy this demand, pumped hydro storage (PHS) global potential is not enough and new technologies with a higher energy density are needed. Hydrogen, with more than 250 times the energy density of PHS is a potential option to satisfy the storage need. However, changes needed in infrastructure to deal with high hydrogen content and the suitability of salt caverns for its storage can pose limitations for this technology. Power to Gas (P2G) arises as possible alternative overcoming both the facilities and the energy density issues. The global storage requirement would represent only 2% of the global annual natural gas production or 10% of the gas storage facilities (in energy equivalent). The more options considered to deal with intermittent sources, the lower the storage requirement will be. Therefore, future studies aiming to quantify storage needs should focus on the entire energy system including technology vectors (e.g. Power to Heat, Liquid, Gas, Chemicals) to avoid overestimating the amount of storage needed. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {The stably-stratified filling of an open enclosure produces an interfacial gradient layer which is transported through the enclosure with the bulk flow. The evolution of this interfacial layer is strongly time-dependent and is driven by the nature of the interaction between the internal gravity waves and the inlet-driven interfacial shear. Measurements of density profile evolution have been completed for a rectangular enclosure with a single corner inlet and density variation produced by saline concentration. This system serves as a mass transfer analog to large-scale, thermally-stratified energy storage devices, preserving dynamic similitude in a laboratory-scale system. The experiments covered jet Reynolds numbers of 200-2200 and Froude numbers of 0.06-0.6 in an enclosure with a width 23 times the jet inlet height. The density profiles are seen to be strongly asymmetric and exhibit growth rates significantly different than due to simple one-dimensional molecular diffusion. In addition, shadowgraph and hydrogen bubble visualizations of the density and velocity fields in the gradient layer show the persistence of complex multi-dimensional flow structure even at relatively late stages of the filling process when the gradient layer has been transported well away from the enclosure inlet. The evolution of the vertical density profile has been compared quantitatively to a quasi one-dimensional model based upon empirical diffusivity coefficients. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A coupled, pore-scale model is presented which aids in the investigation of the mechanisms that govern the conversion of hydrogen to methane, i.e. advective hydrogen flow, its diffusion into microbial biofilms of multiple species, and its consumption within these biofilms. The model assumes that spherical grains are coated by a film of residual water and treats the biofilm development within each film in a quasi one-dimensional manner. A sample simulation using the presented model illustrates the biofilm growth process in these films as well as the competition between three different microbial species: methanogens, acetogens, and acetotrophs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The accidental leakage of high-pressure gas storage systems including tank, pipe, etc. can lead to hazardous jet fires resulting in a serious of disastrous events. With the isentropic process assumption on the high-pressure gas leakage or release, the ideal gas equation of state is firstly used to solve the gas transfer problem, and then the Abel-Noble equation of state (AN-EOS) is adopted for the effect of gas molecule volume. Given both the molecule volume and intermolecular attraction should not be ignored for the high-pressure gas, this paper attempts to build the high-pressure gas leakage process model based on the van der Waals equation of state. Together with the available notional nozzle model and the flame size model, the gas leakage process model is used to calculate the gas state property and flow parameter of hydrogen tank leakage and its subsequent jet flame height. The predicted gas mass flow rate, flame height, and gas pressure and temperature are compared to the experimental measurements for validation and the predictions of the model based on ideal gas equation of state and AN-EOS. It is found that the proposed model can give more encouraging results compared to the previous models. The proposed theoretical model shows a great implication for the calculation of other gas tank leakage and can help to predict the thermal radiation field of jet fires. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Although UHP is widely used as a bleaching and oxidizing agent, its properties as energetic material are generally overlooked. In this work we report comprehensive characterization of UHP explosive and thermal properties. We found that UHP is a compound with a negative value of standard enthalpy of formation (−565.1 kJ mol−1). It is not sensitive to impact and friction. However, we demonstrated that UHP (ρ=0.93 g cm−3; packed into a steel pipe with inner diameter of 206 mm) detonates with experimental velocity of detonation (VOD) of 3780 m s−1. Moreover, for UHP with maximal theoretical density (ρ=1.43 g cm−3), the calculated VOD reaches 5219 m s−1. Based on our findings, we recommend that present regulations regarding the handling, storage and transportation of the UHP should be revised, especially in cases, where UHP is kept on a large scale, under confinement and at places where the temperature can reach above 60 °C. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Indeed, there has been some experimental evidence of enhanced hydrogen uptake in doped Li and other alkali metal systems (Chen et al 1999 Science 285 91). We have therefore addressed this issue of hydrogen storage in Li-doped graphite and carbon nanotube systems theoretically with ab initio simulations. Our results find no evidence for such enhanced storage, based on the induced structural changes. In addition, we have also investigated the diffusion barriers for hydrogen to enter into nanotube interiors, both in the presence and absence of topological defects. Even if nanotube interiors are made accessible, the hydrogen uptake remains modest, i.e., less than 3.5wt%. Mechanically or chemically processing nanotubes is therefore not likely to lead to greatly increased hydrogen storage. Even with its limitation, because of the use of the LDA and GGA approaches, the current investigation must be regarded as a means in the search for proper media that can successfully enhance hydrogen storage. © IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen technologies can play an important role in decarbonising our energy system in a variety of ways across the energy value chain. It is therefore critical to identify the strategic roles as well as the conditions under which hydrogen energy systems become attractive for the energy transition. In this paper, the authors present a techno-economic review of hydrogen energy systems including power-to-power, power-to-gas, hydrogen refuelling and stationary fuel cells. We focus on their optimal operation as flexible assets and we identify three actions that can foster their uptake beyond technological progress. First, we recommend optimal electricity supply with dedicated control strategies considering that electricity dominates the levelised cost of hydrogen production via electrolysis. Secondly, hydrogen can enable the further integration of traditionally independent sectors, namely electricity, heat and transport while contributing to decarbonise all. This position can also be advantageous for investors who sell heat and fuels as energy efficient products. Lastly, we examine a whole range of revenues from different products and applications which can be combined (i.e. benefit stacking) to match capital and operational expenditures. We discuss these roles in depth and we conclude that policy makers together with technology developers should elaborate smart strategies to reduce cost by scaling production, stimulate standardisation (e.g., similar to the PV industry) as well as develop new market structures and regulatory frameworks which allow hydrogen technologies to deliver multiple low carbon applications and products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article gives an overview of the state-of-the-art biomass-based hydrogen production technologies. Various biological and thermochemical processes of biomass are taken into consideration to find the most economical method of hydrogen production. Biohydrogen generated by biophotolysis method, photo-fermentation and dark fermentation is studied with respect to various feedstocks in Malaysia. The fermentation approaches of biohydrogen production have shown great potential to be a future substitute of fossil fuels. Dark fermentation method is a simple biological hydrogen production method that uses a variety of substrate and does not require any light as a source of energy. A promising future for biohydrogen production is anticipated by this process both industrially and commercially. Feasibility of hydrogen production from pyrolysis and water gasification of various biomass feedstock confirm that supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of biomass is the most cost-effective thermochemical process. Highly moisturized biomass could be employed directly in SCWG without any high-cost drying process. Indeed, a small amount of energy is required to pressurize hydrogen in the storage tank because of highly pressurized SCWG process. The cost of hydrogen produced by SCWG of biomass is about US$3/GJ (US$0.35/kg), which is extremely lower than biomass pyrolysis method (in the range of US$8.86/GJ to US$15.52/GJ) and wind-electrolysis systems and PV-electrolysis systems (US$20.2/GJ and US$41.8/GJ, respectively). The best feedstock for biomass-based hydrogen production is identified based on the availability, location of the sources, processes required for the preparation of the feedstock and the total cost of acquiring the feedstock. The cheapest and most abundantly available biomass source in Malaysia is the waste of palm industry. Hydrogen production from palm oil mill effluent and palm solid residue could play a crucial role in the energy mix of Malaysia. Malaysia has this great capability to supply about 40% of its annual energy demand by hydrogen production from SCWG of palm solid waste. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Magnesium hydride is one of the most promising materials for hydrogen storage and high-temperature heat storage. The heat and mass transfer processes occurring in magnesium hydride reactors are very complicated. In the present study, a mathematical model for a magnesium hydride reactor is developed to investigate the mass and heat transfer characteristics under various operating conditions. The distributions of gas velocity, gas pressure, temperature and reacted fraction are obtained by solving the rigorous model. Two versions of the model, which are respectively applied on two different computational domains, are investigated. The simplified version of the model is proved capable of predicting the performance of the magnesium hydride reactor, with high computation efficiency and acceptable accuracy. The simulation results indicate that an increase in hydrogen supply pressure (pin) accelerates the absorption process due to enhanced absorption reaction kinetics. The hydriding time decreases when heat transfer fluid (HTF) velocity (uf) goes up, because the convection heat transfer coefficient between HTF and the magnesium hydride rises with increasing HTF inlet velocity. Moreover, an increase in HTF inlet temperature (Tin) leads to an increase in the equilibrium pressure of the magnesium hydride which decelerates the hydrogen absorption reaction. The optimal setting of the three operating parameters for the magnesium hydride reactor is determined based on the mathematical model, and the corresponding values of the parameters are as follows: pin=2.6MPa, Tin=473K and uf=5ms-1. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A decrease of the cycle time to increase the production rate can be realized by the simultaneous feed of a large number of rovings circumferentially arranged around the mandrel. A team of engineers at the Institut fuer Verbundwerkstoffe (Institute for Composite Materials) now further developed the ring winding technology to manufacture pressure tanks with a diameter up to 500 mm (20 inch) with fully wrapped dome sections. This large ring winding head with 12 radial movable arms and multiple payout eyes allows an accordingly higher material output and reduces the cycle time significantly. The profitability analysis considering ring winding head configurations with different number of feed-eyes show the optimization potential regarding the reduction of the production costs of FRP pressure cylinders. A critical review regarding reachable process efficiency is also given in this paper. A modified "tube siphon impregnation unit" is the most important component of the ring winding head due to its compact and modular design. This clean impregnation of 48 carbon fiber rovings near the winder minimizes possible resin leakages. In comparison to a conventional resin bath the amount of hazardous waste, for example contaminated acetone, can be reduced. FRP laminates (fiber reinforced plastic) with a reduced number of crossing points and less ondulation of fiber bundles result higher load bearing capacity and increased mechanical properties. Regarding the degree of interweaving the multi feed-eye configuration of a ring winding head makes it more challenging to define an optimized winding pattern with the given winding angle. The split disk test method was used for comparative investigations regarding the influence of undulations on the material properties of filament wound laminates. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Conversion of the ocean's vertical thermal energy gradient to electricity via Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) has been demonstrated at small scales over the past century, and represents one of the largest (and growing) potential energy sources on the planet. Here we describe how OTEC could be modified to provide a large source of CO2-emissions-negative energy while also allowing heat removal from the surface ocean, helping to directly counter ocean/atmosphere warming. Most OTEC energy potential is far offshore, thus the conversion of the produced electricity to a chemical energy carrier such as H2 or derivatives is required. This can be achieved by employing a method of electrochemically generating H2 that also consumes CO2, converting the carbon to a common form of ocean alkalinity. The addition of such alkalinity to the ocean would provide high-capacity carbon storage while countering the chemical and biological effects of ocean acidification. For each gigawatt (GW) of continuous electric power generated over one year by the preceding negative-emissions OTEC (NEOTEC), roughly 13 GW of surface ocean heat would be directly removed to deep water, while producing 1.3 × 105 tonnes of H2/yr (avoiding 1.1 × 106 tonnes of CO2 emissions/yr), and consuming and storing (as dissolved mineral bicarbonate) approximately 5 × 106 tonnes CO2/yr. The preceding CO2 mitigation would result in an indirect planetary cooling effect of about 2.6 GW. Such negative-emissions energy production and global warming mitigation would avoid the biophysical and land use limitations posed by methods that rely on terrestrial biology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In Canada there are approximately 300 remote communities not connected to the North American electrical grid or the piped natural gas network. There is a strong incentive to reduce energy costs to spur economic development and growth, while also decreasing reliance on imported fossil fuels. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) have been proposed for the North. However, to be a viable solution, the proposed SMRs must be able to meet fluctuations between peak and average energy demands, and unpredictable generation from variable renewable energy sources. Electrical energy storage could provide the necessary flexibility. A preliminary economic assessment was performed for three energy storage technologies: hydrogen, batteries, and compressed air to assess the viability of each technology. It concluded that storage of electricity may increase the average cost of power generation depending on the market structure, efficiency and energy requirements of the system. Further research is recommended to optimize the energy storage system best suited to an interested community. © 2018 PBNC 2018 - Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Considerable effort is being directed toward updating safety codes and standards in preparation for production, distribution, and retail of hydrogen as a consumer energy source. In the present study, measurements were performed in large-scale, vertical flames to characterize the dimensional and radiative properties of an ignited hydrogen jet. These data are relevant to the safety scenario of a sudden leak in a high-pressure hydrogen containment vessel. Specifically, the data will provide a technological basis for determining hazardous length scales associated with unintended releases at hydrogen storage and distribution centers. Visible and infrared video and ultraviolet flame luminescence imaging were used to evaluate flame length, diameter and structure. Radiometer measurements allowed determination of the radiant heat flux from the flame. The results show that flame length increases with total jet mass flow rate and jet nozzle diameter. When plotted as a function of Froude number, which measures the relative importance of jet momentum and buoyancy, the measured flame lengths for a range of operating conditions collapse onto the same curve. Good comparison with hydrocarbon jet flame lengths is found, demonstrating that the non-dimensional correlations are valid for a variety of fuel types. The radiative heat flux measurements for hydrogen flames show good agreement with non-dimensional correlations and scaling laws developed for a range of fuels and flame conditions. This result verifies that such correlations can be used to predict radiative heat flux from a wide variety of hydrogen flames and establishes a basis for predicting a priori the characteristics of flames resulting from accidental releases. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {The world's richest renewable energy resources - of large geographic extent and high intensity - are stranded: far from end-users with inadequate or nonexistent gathering and transmission systems to deliver the energy. The energy output of most renewables varies greatly, at time scales of seconds to seasons: the energy capture assets thus operate at inherently low capacity factor (CF); energy delivery to end-users is not "firm". New electric transmission systems, or fractions thereof, dedicated to renewables, will suffer the same low CF, and represent substantial stranded capital assets, which increases the cost of delivered renewable-source energy. Electric energy storage cannot affordably firm large renewables at annual scale. At gigawatt (GW = 1,000 MW) scale, renewable-source electricity from diverse sources, worldwide, can be converted to hydrogen and oxygen, via high-pressure-output electrolyzers, with the hydrogen pipelined to load centers (cities, refineries, chemical plants) for use as vehicle fuel, combined-heat-and-power generation on the retail side of the customers' meters, ammonia production, and petroleum refinery feedstock. The oxygen byproduct may be sold to adjacent dry biomass and / or coal gasification plants. Figures 1 - 3. New, large, solution-mined salt caverns in the southern Great Plains, and probably elsewhere in the world, may economically store enough energy as compressed gaseous hydrogen (GH2) to "firm" renewables at annual scale, adding great market and strategic value to diverse, stranded, rich, renewable resources. Figures 2 and 3. For example, Great Plains, USA, wind energy, if fully harvested and "firmed" and transmitted to markets, could supply the entire energy consumption of USA. If gathered, transmitted, and delivered as hydrogen, about 15,000 new solution-mined salt caverns, of ∼8 million cubic feet (225,000 cubic meters) each, would be required, at an incremental.

	abstract = {Various industries including automotive, aerospace, semiconductor manufacturing, military surveillance, commercial communication, fuel cell, solar panel etc. are showing great interests in liquid hydrogen (LH2) as one of the most efficient hydrogen storage methods for their applications. However, there are only few large-scale LH2 plants available in foreign commercial market, which are not readily accessible by researchers and engineers in related fields. In order to acquire hydrogen liquefaction and storage technology and mature them to be applied to future research, a small-scale LH2 plant was developed. The hydrogen liquefaction plant consists of cryocooler, cryostat, liquid nitrogen (LN2) precooling bath, two ortho-para (o-p) hydrogen converters, heat pipe, multilayer insulations, sensors and auxiliary components. The liquefaction plant was designed as both a cryocooler-cooled liquefier and a long-term zero boil-off liquid storage reservoir to meet various demands from applications. A Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler was selected as a cold sink and purchased from Cryomech Inc. A vacuum-jacketed 200 L capacity cryostat was designed to provide highly efficient thermal protection to LH2 storage space by intensive thermal and structural analysis. A heat pipe was uniquely designed and installed in the cryostat to enhance heat transfer between the cryocooler and hydrogen gas and liquid. A LN2-cooled precooling bath was designed in a way that it can act as a precooler and an o-p hydrogen converter at given temperature. A temperature sensor rake, a liquid level sensor and multiple pressure sensors provide thermophysical status of hydrogen in the cryostat to National Instrument data acquisition system in real time. Multilayer insulation blankets with hydrogen getter under high vacuum in the cryostat minimize heat loss into LH2 storage. All the components were carefully assembled in dust, oil and solvent-free environment with extra caution of vacuum tightness followed by dry nitrogen and helium purge. After initial cool-down of the cryocooler under vacuum, 99.999% of 300K hydrogen gas was introduced to the liquefaction plant. From a series of liquefaction tests with or without LN2 precooling, the hydrogen liquefaction plant successfully demonstrated 1.4 L/hr of hydrogen liquefaction with LN2 precooling and two o-p hydrogen converters, and 0.7 L/hr without LN2 precooling.},

	abstract = {New techniques and methods for energy storage are required for the transition to a renewable power supply, termed “Energiewende” in Germany. Energy storage in the geological subsurface provides large potential capacities to bridge temporal gaps between periods of production of solar or wind power and consumer demand and may also help to relieve the power grids. Storage options include storage of synthetic methane, hydrogen or compressed air in salt caverns or porous formations as well as heat storage in porous formations. In the ANGUS+ project, heat and gas storage in porous media and salt caverns and aspects of their use on subsurface spatial planning concepts are investigated. The optimal dimensioning of storage sites, the achievable charging and discharging rates and the effective storage capacity as well as the induced thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, geochemical and microbial effects are studied. The geological structures, the surface energy infrastructure and the governing processes are parameterized, using either literature data or own experimental studies. Numerical modeling tools are developed for the simulation of realistically defined synthetic storage scenarios. The feasible dimensioning of storage applications is assessed in site-specific numerical scenario analyses, and the related spatial extents and time scales of induced effects connected with the respective storage application are quantified. Additionally, geophysical monitoring methods, which allow for a better spatial resolution of the storage operation, induced effects or leakages, are evaluated based on these scenario simulations. Methods for the assessment of such subsurface geological storage sites are thus developed, which account for the spatial extension of the subsurface operation itself as well as its induced effects and the spatial requirements of adequate monitoring methods. © 2016, The Author(s).},

The dynamics associated with the grid demand, renewable power, pressure, and HES capacity for one week each of November and August were analyzed in detail while a higher level analysis of the entire state for the whole year was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. It was found that the existing natural gas storage facilities may be converted to hydrogen storage facilities to store otherwise curtailed renewable energy through solid oxide electrolysis (SOE). Moreover, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) systems can also be used to dispatch the hydrogen back to the grid as power.

	abstract = {The future success of fuel cell electric vehicles requires a corresponding infrastructure. In this study, two different refueling station concepts for fuel cell passenger cars with 70 MPa technology were evaluated energetically. In the first option, the input of the refueling station is gaseous hydrogen which is compressed to final pressure, remaining in gaseous state. In the second option, the input is liquid hydrogen which is cryo-compressed directly from the liquid phase to the target pressure. In the first case, the target temperature of −33 °C to −40 °C [1] is achieved by cooling down. In the second option, gaseous deep-cold hydrogen coming from the pump is heated up to target temperature. A dynamic simulation model considering real gas behavior to evaluate both types of fueling stations from an energetic perspective was created. The dynamic model allows the simulation of boil-off losses (liquid stations) and standby energy losses caused by the precooling system (gaseous station) dependent on fueling profiles. The functionality of the model was demonstrated with a sequence of three refueling processes within a short time period (high station utilization). The liquid station consumed 0.37 kWh/kg compared to 2.43 kWh/kg of the gaseous station. Rough estimations indicated that the energy consumption of the entire pathway is higher for liquid hydrogen. The analysis showed the high influence of the high-pressure storage system design on the energy consumption of the station. For future research work the refueling station model can be applied to analyze the energy consumption dependent on factors like utilization, component sizing and ambient temperature. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The heat transfer to/from the metal hydride reactor bed is one of the major controlling parameters of the storage process. Consequently, a variety of heat transfer techniques have been employed till date to improve the system performance. In this review, an effort has been made to summarize the developments so far, assess the effectiveness of various heat transfer techniques and draw some inferences from the study which can contribute to a more effective design of heat transfer systems. Upon a comprehensive study of the existing literature a classification of heat transfer techniques was attempted and their relative effectiveness assessed with respect to system scale. It was observed that improvement of only thermal conductivity or heat transfer coefficient will not be able to improve system performance. An effective design should take into account the influence of both these parameters concurrently. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Windplants are the lowest-cost new renewable energy sources. A 1000 Mw windplant in the large wind resource of the North America Great Plains, delivering exclusively hydrogen fuel, via a new gaseous hydrogen (GH2) pipeline, to an urban market at least 300 km distant, was modeled. With various value-adders, wind-source GH2 may be delivered to distant markets at an untaxed wholesale energy unit cost apparently competitive with, at year 2005 market prices. Pipeline energy storage smoothed windplant output variations at time scales of minutes to days. Low-cost, seasonal-scale, geologic storage of GH2 could theoretically firm wind energy, adding significant value. Such storage remains technically unexplored and unproven in the Great Plains, beyond the Texas Gulf Coast region. A quantifiable difference between the prices of firm and non-firm natural gas (NG) today was observed, but the annual price profile of hydrogen might be quite different from the current NG price profile. The remaining challenge is determining whether storage or spot purchases is the lower-cost firming option for wind-source GH2 fuel. Line pipe materials must be tested and selected, and other measures taken, to control the critical phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement of steel, also known as hydrogen corrosion cracking and SCC. The most economical design point was to size the electrolyzer units to match the maximum pipeline capacity and then to slightly oversize the wind generation, by 20-35%, which wastes some wind generation but increases the overall utilization factor of the system.

	abstract = {Humanity must soon "run the world on renewables" - plus some degree of nuclear - but cannot, and should not try to, accomplish this entirely with electricity transmission. We need to supply all energy, not just electricity, from diverse renewable energy (RE) resources, both distributed and centralized, where the world's richest RE resources - of large geographic extent and high intensity - are stranded: far from end-users with inadequate or nonexistent gathering and transmission systems to deliver the energy. Electricity energy storage cannot affordably firm large, intermittent renewables at annual scale, while carbon-free gaseous hydrogen (GH2) and liquid anhydrous ammonia (NH3) fuels can, at < US$ 1.00 / kWh capital cost: GH2 in large solution-mined salt caverns, NH3 in surface tanks, both pressurized and refrigerated. Energy content of these fuels: 1 kg GH2 = 39.4 kWh (HHV) or 33.3 kWh (LHV) 1 kg NH3 = 6.3 kWh (HHV) or 5.2 kWh (LHV) Higher heating value (HHV) and lower heating value (LHV) of fuels differ by the heat of vaporization of water. We need to conceive, analyze, strategize, snd commit to building complete RE systems, from photons and moving air and water molecules to firm and dispatchable energy services delivered to distant end-users. Natural gas energy systems may be a better model than a "smarter" electricity grid. "Smart Grid" is emerging as primarily a DSM (demand side management) strategy to encourage energy conservation. Making the electricity grid "smarter" does not: 1. Increase physical transmission capacity; 2. Provide affordable annual-scale firming storage for RE; 3. Solve grid integration problem for large, time-varying RE; 4. Alleviate "not in my back yard" (NIMBY) objections to new transmission siting; 5. Reduce the high O&M costs of overhead electric lines. The "smarter" grid may be more vulnerable to cyberattack than today's grid. Adding storage, control, and power quality adjunct devices to the electricity grid, to accommodate very high RE content, may be technically and economically inferior to the GH2 and NH3 RE systems discussed here. Thus, we need to look beyond "smart grid", expanding our concept of "transmission", to synergistically and simultaneously solve the transmission, firming storage, and RE integration "balancing" problems now severely constraining our progress toward "running the world on renewables". Today's energy industry is very water-intensive, consuming ∼17,000 × 10∧9 liters of fresh water annually in USA. If total USA annual energy - from all sources, for all uses - were generated as RE-source electricity and converted to GH2 and / or NH3 fuels for transmission, total freshwater feedstock consumption, about one-fourth liter per kWh, would be ∼900 × 10∧9 liters per year. This is far less than ∼17,000 × 109 liters the USA energy sector "consumed" in 2005. For example, a 1,000 MW windplant, operating at 40% capacity factor (CF), producing ∼3,500 TWh (TWh = 109 kWh) per year, would consume ∼800 × 10∧6 liters of freshwater feedstock per year. Transportation electrification does not necessarily require battery electric vehicles (BEV's). GH2 and / or NH3 fuels would supply electric energy to the drive system via fuel cells, and may provide longer range at lower cost, greater energy security, and with better access to large, stranded, RE resources as annually-firm energy than an expanded and "smarter" electricity grid could provide. The energy industry now needs to conceive, design, bid, build, and operate pilot plants by which to discover and demonstrate the technical and economic advantages - if any - of RE-source GH2 and / or NH3 fuel transmission, storage, and delivery systems, as humanity urgently proceeds to "run the world on renewables".},

	abstract = {In ammonia-based solar thermochemical energy storage systems (TCES), solar energy is stored via endothermic ammonia dissociation reaction and released when the ammonia synthesis reaction is utilized to heat the working fluid for a power block. It has been shown that a working fluid i.e., supercritical steam, can be heated in an ammonia synthesis reactor to 650 °C. In this paper, steam and supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) are proposed to be heated to a higher temperature, i.e., 800 °C, utilizing the ammonia synthesis in the context of ammonia-based TCES. Steam at 800 °C has the potential to be used for high-temperature electrolysis with a relatively high electrical-to-hydrogen efficiency. Supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) at 800 °C can be used for a high temperature Brayton cycle, which has the potential to achieve a more compact power cycle with higher efficiency than steam Rankine cycle. Two different synthesis systems, i.e., System I and System II, are designed in this paper for achieving heating the working fluid i.e., steam or sCO2. System I consists of a heat recovery reactor to heat the working fluid with ammonia synthesis, a preconditioning system and an autothermal synthesis reactor to preheat the synthesis gas. System II is similar to System I except the heat recovery reactor is replaced by a heat exchanger, which eliminates the need for another catalyst-filled reactor. A two-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model is developed to simulate heating of the working fluid in reactors of the systems. Another two-dimensional model is developed to simulate the heat transfer process in heat exchangers. The results demonstrated the feasibility of heating steam or sCO2 to 800 °C in the two systems. But the autothermal synthesis reactors for preheating the synthesis gas are required to be relatively large for both systems. The autothermal synthesis reactor in System II is required to be even larger than that in System I since the synthesis gas without reaction in a heat exchanger need be preheated to a higher temperature. The result shows both the required catalyst volume and reactor wall volume of System I are lower than System II. This study provides a baseline for further design refinement and economic analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {While there is a consensus in the literature that embracing nanodevices and nanomaterials helps in improving the efficiency and performance, the reason for the better performance is mostly subscribed to the nanosized material/structure of the system without sufficiently acknowledging the role of fluid flow mechanisms in these systems. This is evident from the literature review of fluid flow modeling in various energy-related applications, which reveals that the fundamental understanding of fluid transport at micro- and nanoscale is not adequately adapted in models. Incomplete or insufficient physics for the fluid flow can lead to untapped potential of these applications that can be used to increase their performance. This paper reviews the current state of research for the physics of gas and liquid flow at micro- and nanoscale and identified critical gaps to improve fluid flow modeling in four different applications related to the energy sector. The review for gas flow focuses on fundamentals of gas flow at rarefied conditions, the velocity slip, and temperature jump conditions. The review for liquid flow provides fundamental flow regimes of liquid flow, and liquid slip models as a function of key modeling parameters. The four porous media applications from energy sector considered in this review are (i) electrokinetic energy conversion devices, (ii) membrane-based water desalination through reverse osmosis, (iii) shale reservoirs, and (iv) hydrogen storage, respectively. Review of fluid flow modeling literature from these applications reveals that further improvements can be made by (i) modeling slip length as a function of key parameters, (ii) coupling the dependency of wettability and slip, (iii) using a reservoir-on-chip approach that can enable capturing the subcontinuum effects contributing to fluid flow in shale reservoirs, and (iv) including Knudsen diffusion and slip in the governing equations of hydrogen gas storage. © 2018 Harpreet Singh and Rho Shin Myong.},

The bivalve Mytilus edulis is an important contributor to this service, and is used in managing eutrophic waters. Studies show that they are affected by changes in pH due to ocean acidification, reducing their growth. This is forecasted to lead to reductions in M. edulis biomass of up to 50% by 2100. Growth reduction will negatively affect the filtering capacity of each individual, potentially leading to a decrease in bioremediation of waste. This paper critically reviews the current state of knowledge of bioremediation of waste carried out by M. edulis, and the current knowledge of the resultant effect of ocean acidification on this key service. We show that the effects of ocean acidification on waste bioremediation could be a major issue and pave the way for empirical studies of the topic. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) pipelines are more susceptible to long running fractures than hydrocarbon gas pipelines because of the decompression characteristics of CO2. The key to understanding this issue is the phase diagram and the liquid-vapour phase boundary. GASDECOM - based on the BWRS equation of state - is a program widely used for calculating the decompression behaviour of mixtures of hydrocarbons. The calculated decompression wave velocity curve is then used in models such as the Battelle Two Curve Model to determine the toughness required to arrest a propagating ductile fracture. GASDECOM is capable of modelling mixtures of hydrocarbons (methane through to hexane), nitrogen and carbon dioxide. It therefore can (and has) been used to investigate the effect of methane and nitrogen on the decompression characteristics of CO2. Pipelines can be expected to play a significant role in the transportation infrastructure required for the successful implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The composition of the carbon dioxide rich stream to be transported in a pipeline depends on the capture technology, e.g. post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-fuel. Post-combustion tends to result in an almost pure stream. The other capture technologies produce a less pure stream, containing potentially significant proportions of other components such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, argon and methane. One of the factors that will constrain the design and operation of a carbon dioxide pipeline is the effect of these other components on the decompression characteristics, and hence the arrest toughness (amongst other issues). Components such as hydrogen, oxygen and argon cannot currently be considered using GASDECOM. Through a study of the underlying algorithms implemented in GASDECOM, it is shown how GASDECOM can be modified to include these additional components relevant to carbon capture and storage. The effect of impurities such as hydrogen on the decompression characteristics is then illustrated, and related back to their effect on the phase diagram and the liquid-vapour phase boundary. The sensitivity of the results to the use of equations of state other than BWRS is also illustrated. Simplifications that follow from the decompression behaviour of carbon dioxide are also highlighted. Finally, the small and large scale experimental studies that are required to validate predictions of the decompression behaviour and the arrest toughness are discussed. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the conceptual design for a two-step thermochemical cycle producing hydrogen continuously, even off-sun, with the concentrated solar energy as the heat source. For a case study, the two-step iron oxide cycle (Fe3O4/FeO) is selected to illustrate the design concept. Two reactors, one storage tank and the solar collector comprise the system. Molten wustite (FeO) is accumulated in the storage tank on-sun. The FeO is not only involved in the reactions but also acts as the heat transfer medium, obtaining the energy from the solar insolation and delivering energy to support the thermal decomposition of magnetite (Fe3O4). In this way, the temperature limitation (<800 K) of molten salt is solved, and the intermittency problem of variable insolation is circumvented. A simple feedback scheme is used to control the flow rate between the storage tank and the reactors in order to minimize the temperature fluctuations. For the wustite hydrolysis reaction, the volumetric flow rate of water is regulated to control the temperature in the reactor. We derived the kinetics of the two-step iron oxide cycle from previous experimental reports. We simulated the dynamics of the system over 50 days with mass and energy balances. The simulation results show that the storage tank temperature will be stationary at 2250 K. After five days, the decomposition temperature at 2100 K, and the hydrogen production stabilized at 7 kg/min. Admitting the difficulty of high temperature operation, this design is still promising due to the high efficiency of two-step cycle itself, the process intensification of the FeO acting as the reactant/product/heat transfer medium (no need of heat exchangers), and the continuous operation/production of hydrogen. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

One of the merits of such MONOS-type memories is that they can trap charges inside atomic-scale defect sites in SiNlayers. At the same time, however, charge traps with atomistic scale tend to induce additional large structural changes. Hydrogen has attracted a great attention as an important heteroatom in MONOS-type memories. We theoretically investigate the basic characteristics of hydrogen-defects in SiN layer in MONOS-type memories on the basis of the first-principles calculations.

	abstract = {Hydrogen production via steam methane reforming (SMR) dominates the supply to refining complexes worldwide, resulting in significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a considerable demand for clean hydrogen pathways that are economically competitive with SMR. The development of a 563 MW integrated wind-hydrogen model with energy storage is proposed. The model utilizes real-time wind energy data to ascertain the optimal size of the electrolyser, the number of electrolyser units and the battery (energy storage) capacity that will yield a minimum hydrogen production cost, whilst functioning in a liberalized electricity market with dynamic prices. The optimal plant configuration consists of 81 units of a 3496 kW (760 Nm3/hr) electrolyser and 360 MWh (60 units) of battery capacity. For the minimum hydrogen production cost determined ($9.00//kg H2), the wind farm accounts for 63% of this cost. Hence, if existing wind farm assets are used, such that the investment cost of building the wind-hydrogen plant does not include the wind farm costs, the hydrogen production cost is reduced to $3.37/kg H2. For a particular electrolyser-battery configuration, it was observed that the minimum hydrogen production cost occurs when their respective capacity factors are approximately equivalent. The benefits of energy storage are limited by the decrease in overall plant efficiency, which results from the use of the battery. For the techno-economic conditions considered in this paper, hydrogen production costs from wind powered electrolysis ($3.37 to $9.00/kg H2) are uncompetitive with SMR/SMR-CCS ($1.87 to $2.60/kg H2). © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.},

	abstract = {In support of its goal to find an innovative path for human space exploration, NASA embarked on the Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer (CPST) Project, a Technology Demonstration Mission (TDM) to test and validate key cryogenic capabilities and technologies required for future exploration elements, opening up the architecture for large in-space cryogenic propulsion stages and propellant depots. Planning for a demonstration mission began in 2010, and over several years the project has evolved from a very large, hydrogen and oxygen Flagship Technology Demonstrator to a single fluid (hydrogen) TDM. Through the work of a dedicated team, the mission successfully passed critical milestones including Mission Concept Review (MCR), Systems Requirements Review (SRR) and Mission Definition Review (MDR), and Key Decision Point B giving the project management authority to proceed to Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Despite these technical and programmatic successes, in February 2014, the funding appropriated to NASA by the Congress was not sufficient to continue with the flight mission, and the project was redirected to a less costly ground test and analysis activity to commence in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. In addition to developing and maturing a concept for the flight demonstration, the team completed significant advances to the cryogenic fluid management technology field. Recognizing that key Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) technologies anticipated for on-orbit (flight) demonstration would benefit from additional maturation to a readiness level appropriate for infusion into the design of the flight demonstration, the NASA Headquarters Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) authorized funding for a 1-year technology maturation phase of the CPST project. The strategy, proposed by the CPST Project Manager, focused on maturation through modeling, concept studies, and ground tests of the storage and fluid transfer CFM technology subelements and components that were lower than a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5. A technology maturation plan (TMP) was subsequently approved which described: the CFM technologies selected for maturation, the ground testing approach to be used, quantified success criteria of the technologies, hardware and data deliverables, and a deliverable to provide an assessment of the technology readiness after completion of the test, study or modeling activity. The specific technologies selected were grouped into five major categories: thick multilayer insulation, tank applied active thermal control, cryogenic fluid transfer, propellant gauging, and analytical tool development. Based on the success of the technology maturation efforts, the CPST project was approved to proceed to flight system development. © 2014 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

	abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide generation is the key cause of sewer pipe corrosion, one of the major issues in water infrastructure. Current abatement strategies typically involve addition of various types of chemicals to the wastewater, which incurs large operational costs. The transport, storage and application of these chemicals also constitute occupational and safety hazards. In this study, we investigated high rate electrochemical oxidation of sulfide at Ir/Ta mixed metal oxide (MMO) coated titanium electrodes as a means to remove sulfide from wastewater. Both synthetic and real wastewaters were used in the experiments. Electrochemical sulfide oxidation by means of indirect oxidation with in-situ produced oxygen appeared to be the main reaction mechanism at Ir/Ta MMO coated titanium electrodes. The maximum obtained sulfide removal rate was 11.8 ± 1.7 g S m-2 projected anode surface h-1 using domestic wastewater at sulfide concentrations of ≥30 mg L-1 or higher. The final products of the oxidation were sulfate, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur. Chloride and acetate concentrations did not entail differences in sulfide removal, nor were the latter two components affected by the electrochemical oxidation. Hence, the use of electrodes to generate oxygen in sewer systems may constitute a promising method for reagent-free removal of sulfide from wastewater. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A 3D mathematical model is developed for this system and is used for simulating various configurations (Case 1: MH tank with PCM heat exchanger, Case 2: MH tank with PCM heat exchanger and open HTF pipe and Case 3: MH tank with PCM heat exchanger and closed HTF pipe). For each case, advantages and limitations are evaluated with respect to their heat transfer performance and filling time of hydrogen vis-a-vis heat storage capacity. In addition, the effects of the HTF type and its mass flow rate on the performance of the MH tank are studied. Besides showing a thermal coupling between MH bed, HTF pipe and PCM medium, the computational results indicate that the use of HTF pipe in MH-PCM tank is a tradeoff between reducing the hydrogen filling time and compromising the heat storage capacity. The results indicate that compared to the Case 1 (without HTF pipe) the filling time can be reduced by 94% for the Case 2 where the HTF pipe extracts 70% of the heat of reaction and delivers it to environment as waste heat. However, the filling time is reduced by only 72% for the Case 3 where all the heat of reaction is stored in PCM. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Steam methane reforming is suitable for thermochemical energy storage because of its large reaction enthalpy and high hydrogen content in reaction products. In this paper, heat transfer and storage performance of steam methane reforming in a tubular reactor heated by focused solar simulator is experimental demonstrated and numerically analyzed. According to experimental results, methane conversion remarkably decreases with inlet flow rate rising, while thermochemical energy storage efficiency first increases for more reactants and then decreases with methane conversion dropping. As incident energy flux rises, methane conversion increases with bed temperature rising, and the thermochemical energy storage efficiency reaches its maximum of 11.3% with central heat flux of 285.6 kW/m2. Three-dimensional transport and volumetric reaction model with concentrated energy flux boundary condition is established and validated, and local and integral energy transport and storage performance are further analyzed. Along flow direction, the maximum reaction rate appears before the focal point with maximum energy flux. The tendencies of methane conversion and thermochemical energy storage efficiency are very similar under different inlet conditions, and higher inlet temperature and appropriate steam to methane ratio benefit thermochemical energy storage. The structures of catalyst bed and reactor are critical important for thermochemical energy storage process. As bed length increases, the methane conversion and thermochemical energy storage efficiency first increase with the increase of positive reaction and then decrease with the increase of reverse reaction, and the optimal length is a little larger than focal spot diameter. When bed porosity is increased, the methane conversion and thermochemical energy storage efficiency first increases with the flow resistance decreasing and then decreases with catalyst amount decreasing, and optimal porosity is 0.45. Heat loss in heating side of bed region play major role in heat storage, and the thermochemical energy storage efficiency can be improved to 34.8% by using insulation and coating. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current international standards and codes dedicated to the design of pressure vessels do not properly ensure fitness for service of vessels used for gaseous hydrogen storage and subjected to hydrogen enhanced fatigue. In this context, the European project MATHRYCE intends to propose an easy to implement vessel design methodology based on lab-scale tests and taking into account hydrogen enhanced fatigue. In the present document the lab-scale experimental developments and results are presented. The material considered was a commercially available Q&T low alloy Cr-Mo steel from a seamless pressure vessel. Due to the high hydrogen diffusion at room temperature in such steel, all the tests were performed under hydrogen pressure to avoid outgassing. Different types of lab-scale tests were developed and used in order to identify the most promising one for a design code. The effect of mechanical parameters, such as H2 pressure, frequency and ΔK, on fatigue crack initiation and propagation was analyzed. In particular, special attention was paid on the influence of H2 on the relative parts of initiation and propagation in the fatigue life of a component. The second part of the work was dedicated to cyclic hydraulic and hydrogen pressure tests on full scale vessels. Three artificial defects with different geometries per cylinder were machined in the inner wall of each tested cylinder. They were specifically designed in order to detect fatigue crack initiation and fatigue crack propagation with a single test. The final goal of this work is to propose a methodology to derive a "hydrogen safety factor" from lab-scale tests. The proposed method is compared to the full-scale results obtained, leading to recommendations on the design of pressure components operating under cyclic hydrogen pressure.

The most important thing for different storage methods is to establish the aisles of the hydrogen to storage space, and efficiently drill a few high-quality well holes. Compound drilling is one of the alternative technologies. However, the bit-rock interaction and the drill string-borehole interaction make the movement of bottom hold assembly more complex and increase the difficulty of well trajectory control. The vibration characteristics of drill string during compound drilling are not clear. The numerical simulation model of drill string with positive displacement motor is established by considering the bit-rock interaction, the rock failure behavior, the drill string-borehole interaction and the drill string structural. The mechanical parameters of shale for the numerical model are measured by wave velocities method. The simulation model is verified by the measuring and motoring data of axial force in the field. The rock element damage failure rate of compound drilling is greater than conventional drilling. The axial force and torque of bit of drill string in compound drilling is greater than that in the conventional drilling. The drill string is in contact with the wellbore in a more complicated way during compound drilling. The research results are benefit for optimal design of borehole quality. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {                             The use of hydrogen as a non-emission energy carrier is important for the innovative development of the power-generation industry. Transmission pipelines are the most efficient and economic method of transporting large quantities of hydrogen in a number of variants. A comprehensive hydraulic analysis of hydrogen transmission at a mass flow rate of 0.3 to 3.0 kg/s (volume flow rates from 12,000 Nm                             3                             /h to 120,000 Nm                             3                             /h) was performed. The methodology was based on flow simulation in a pipeline for assumed boundary conditions as well as modeling of fluid thermodynamic parameters for pure hydrogen and its mixtures with methane. The assumed outlet pressure was 24 bar (g). The pipeline diameter and required inlet pressure were calculated for these parameters. The change in temperature was analyzed as a function of the pipeline length for a given real heat transfer model; the assumed temperatures were 5 and 25                             ◦                             C. The impact of hydrogen on natural gas transmission is another important issue. The performed analysis revealed that the maximum participation of hydrogen in natural gas should not exceed 15%–20%, or it has a negative impact on natural gas quality. In the case of a mixture of 85% methane and 15% hydrogen, the required outlet pressure is 10% lower than for pure methane. The obtained results present various possibilities of pipeline transmission of hydrogen at large distances. Moreover, the changes in basic thermodynamic parameters have been presented as a function of pipeline length for the adopted assumptions.                          © 2019 by the authors},

The characteristics of relative permeability were analyzed under different values of Hydrogen bond (∏h), Double layer repulsive force (∏e), Long-range van der Waals force (∏w) and Short-range structure repulsive force (∏s). The result shows that the interfacial effects can promote the fluid flow in the nanoporous media and the relationship is as follows: ∏h>∏e>∏w>∏s. ∏h and ∏e improve spreading obviously, which are accounted for more than 70%.Then the ∏w affects spreading accounts for 1/5 nearly. In addition, the analysis of fractal dimension on relative permeability is carried out to indicate that the gas-water relative permeability decreases with the increase of the fractal dimension.

To support the development of these methods, a new high-pressure stagnation chamber has been integrated into Sandia National Laboratories' Turbulent Combustion Laboratory so that relevant compressed gas release scenarios can be replicated. For the present study, a jet with a 10:1 pressure ratio issuing from a small 0.75 mm radius nozzle has been examined. Jet exit shock structure was imaged by Schlieren photography, while quantitative Planar Laser Rayleigh Scatter imaging was used to measure instantaneous hydrogen mole fractions downstream of the Mach disk. Measured concentration statistics and ignitable boundary predictions compared favorably to analytic reconstructions of downstream jet dispersion behavior. Model results were produced from subsonic jet dispersion models and by invoking self-similarity jet scaling arguments with length scaling by experimentally measured effective source radii. Similar far field reconstructions that relied on various notional nozzle models to account for complex jet exit shock phenomena failed to satisfactorily predict the experimental findings. These results indicate further notional nozzle refinement is needed to improve the prediction fidelity.

	abstract = {The current international standards and codes dedicated to the design of pressure vessels do not properly ensure fitness for service of such vessel used for gaseous hydrogen storage and subjected to hydrogen enhanced fatigue. Yet, hydrogen can reduce the fatigue life in two ways: by decreasing the crack initiation period and by increasing the fatigue crack growth rate. The European project MATHRYCE aims are to propose an easy to implement vessel design methodology based on lab-scale tests and taking into account hydrogen enhanced fatigue. The study is focused on a low alloy Cr-Mo steel, exhibiting a tempered bainitic and martensitic microstructure, and classically used to store hydrogen gas up to 45 MPa. Due to hydrogen diffusion at room temperature in such steel, tests have to be performed under hydrogen pressure to avoid outgassing. In the present work, experimental procedures have been developed to study both crack initiation and crack growth. The specimens and tests instrumentation have been specifically designed to quantitatively measure in-situ these two stages under high hydrogen pressure. We developed and tested crack gages located close to a small drilled notch. This notch simulates the presence of steel nonmetallic inclusions and other microstructural features that can affect fatigue crack initiation and propagation. The experimental results addressing the effects of the testing conditions, such as stress ratio, frequency and hydrogen pressure will be compared to the local strain and stress fields obtained by Finite Element Method and correlated to the possible hydrogen enhanced fatigue mechanisms involved.

	abstract = {Renewable Energy Sources (RES) exploitation for electric energy and hydrogen production has been identified as one of the leading ways towards a future sustainable energy system. Hydrogen can be stored and transported in gaseous (GH2) or liquid form (LH2). When large hydrogen storage is required, liquefaction can be convenient with respect to compression, because of its higher storage density. LH2 can also be used as a coolant for superconducting lines, acting at the same time as energy vector and cryogen. In particular, in this paper we focus on the MgB2 material mainly due to economic considerations and working temperature match with LH2. A system for large scale RES exploitation allowing flexible and controlled delivery of electric energy and LH2 is presented. For the thermo-hydraulic design, a method is proposed which resorts to compressible fluid equations put in a convenient simplified form. A case application with 20 km distance between cooling stations is considered, and the need of taking into account LH2 compressibility for pipeline design is shown. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has been highlighted as a potential method to enable the continued use of fossil-fuelled power stations through the abatement of carbon dioxide (CO2). A complete CCS cycle requires safe, reliable and cost effective solutions for the transmission of CO2 from the capturing facility to the location of permanent storage. This publication presents a detailed review of the integrity risks posed to dense-phase CO2 pipelines in the form of internal corrosion. To begin, the current worldwide experience in handling dense-phase CO2 and the anthropogenic stream compositions expected from the different combustion techniques currently available are discussed. The anticipated compositions are then related to a number of tentative CO2 stream compositions available in open literature proposed by research institutes and pipeline operators. In subsequent sections, early laboratory and field corrosion experience relating to natural dense-phase CO2 transport for the purposes of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are summarised along with more recent research efforts which focus on identifying the role of anthropogenic impurities in the degradation processes. For each system impurity, the reaction rates, mechanisms and corrosion product composition/morphology expected at the steel surfaces are discussed, as well as each component’s ability to influence the critical water content required to initiate corrosion. Potential bulk phase reactions between multiple impurities are also evaluated in an attempt to help understand how the impurity content may evolve along a long-distance pipeline. The likelihood of stress-corrosion cracking and hydrogen-induced cracking is discussed and the various corrosion mitigation techniques which exist to control degradation to acceptable levels are reviewed. Based on the current research performed in the context of impure dense-phase CO2 corrosion, issues associated with performing laboratory experiments to replicate field conditions and the challenges such limitations present in terms of defining the safe operating window for CO2 transport are considered. © 2016 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and ASM International.},

	abstract = {We review liquid hydrogen (LH2) as a maritime vessel fuel, from descriptions of its fundamental properties to its practical application and safety aspects, in the context of the San Francisco Bay Renewable Energy Electric Vessel with Zero Emissions (SF-BREEZE) high-speed fuel-cell ferry. Since marine regulations have been formulated to cover liquid natural gas (LNG) as a primary propulsion fuel, we frame our examination of LH2as a comparison to LNG, for both maritime use in general, and the SF-BREEZE in particular. Due to weaker attractions between molecules, LH2is colder than LNG, and evaporates more easily. We describe the consequences of these physical differences for the size and duration of spills of the two cryogenic fuels. The classical flammability ranges are reviewed, with a focus on how fuel buoyancy modifies these combustion limits. We examine the conditions for direct fuel explosion (detonation) and contrast them with initiation of normal (laminar) combustion. Direct fuel detonation is not a credible accident scenario for the SF-BREEZE. For both fuels, we review experiments and theory elucidating the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT). LH2fires have a shorter duration than energy-equivalent LNG fires, and produce significantly less thermal radiation. The thermal (infrared) radiation from hydrogen fires is also strongly absorbed by humidity in the air. Hydrogen permeability is not a leak issue for practical hydrogen plumbing. We describe the chemistry of hydrogen and methane at iron surfaces, clarifying their impact on steel-based hydrogen storage and transport materials. These physical, chemical and combustion properties are pulled together in a comparison of how a LH2or LNG pool fire on the Top Deck of the SF-BREEZE might influence the structural integrity of the aluminum deck. Neither pool fire scenario leads to net heating of the aluminum decking. Overall, LH2and LNG are very similar in their physical and combustion properties, thereby posing similar safety risks. For ships utilizing LH2or LNG, precautions are needed to avoid fuel leaks, minimize ignition sources, minimize confined spaces, provide ample ventilation for required confined spaces, and to monitor the enclosed spaces to ensure any fuel accumulation is detected far below the fuel/air mix threshold for any type of combustion. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Metal hydride beds play an important role in the application of hydrogen-related energy. In the present work, a full-scale DU (depleted uranium) bed with the newly proposed bed design of thin double-layered annulus configuration was fabricated for hydrogen isotopes recovery and delivery. The hydrogen recovery/delivery properties and the thermal effect of the fabricated bed were experimentally investigated. It was found that the fabricated bed was able to achieve the hydrogen storage target of 17.5 mol H2 with a fast hydrogen recovery rate. Not only hydrogen delivery amount as high as 16.5 mol (~94% of recovery amount) but also an average delivery rate of 20 Pa m3/s could be obtained at 450 °C, even though the hydrogen delivery time of the bed reached as long as 30.9 min. The fabricated DU bed also exhibited outstanding cyclic hydrogen recovery/delivery performances. Deterioration in both hydrogen recovery/delivery amount and rate was not observed even up to 10 cycles. Besides, it was shown that utilization of the water cooling loops drilled in the DU bed was beneficial to enhance the heat transfer and promote the hydrogen recovery process of the bed. Meanwhile, the internal structure of the fabricated bed was observed by ICT (industrial computed tomography). And the ICT results demonstrated that DU expanded seriously after hydrogen recovery/delivery cycles, resulting in the deformation of the filters in the bed. The experimental results suggested that the fabricated DU bed was technically feasible to be applied for hydrogen isotopes recovery and delivery in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The area of COFs is rapidly developing in the direction of finding potential applications in fields like gas storage, photovoltaics, and catalysis. With respect to hydrogen storage, at first glance, COFs possess all the advantages of metal-organic frameworks (surface area, pore volume, rigidity of the structure). In addition, since the molecular frameworks of COFs are composed of light elements (C, Si, B, and O), these materials have exceptionally low densities. Due to this advantage, a lot of research activity (both theoretical and experimental) was reported in the recent literature on hydrogen-storage properties of COFs. Also, several strategies were suggested for enhancing H2-storage capacities of COFs at cryogenic as well as room temperatures. In this feature article, we broadly discuss the scope of COFs as hydrogen storage media and also review the strategies suggested for enhanced room-temperature hydrogen-storage properties. Further, the concept of "spillover" is reviewed critically in metal@COFs and metal@MOFs systems. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

Components of this system are a turbine, generator, evaporator, condenser, pumps, photovoltaic panels, electrolyzer, hydrogen tanks, fuel cell and converter. To evaluate the proposed hybrid system, energy, exergy and economic analysis are employed. For OTEC, an optimization algorithm is applied to find the optimum working fluid (R134A, R407C, R410A, R717, R404A, and R423A), evaporation and condensation temperatures, and cold and warm seawater temperature differences between the inlet and outlet of evaporator/condenser. The results demonstrate that the maximum specific power of OTEC was achieved to be 0.3622 kW/m2 for R717 and 0.3294 kW/m2 for R423A working fluids. The overall energy efficiency for the hybrid renewable energy system was obtained 3.318%. The maximum energy loss was occurred by the turbine. The exergy efficiency of the hybrid system was obtained 18.35% and the payback period of the proposed system was obtained around 8 years.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the economic feasibility of power-to-gas (P2G) systems and gas storage options for both hydrogen and renewable methane. The study is based on a techno-economic model in which the net present value (NPV) method and Monte Carlo simulation of risks and price forward curves for the electricity and the gas market are used. We study three investment cases: A Base Case where the gas is directly sold in the market, a Storage & Arbitrage Case where temporal arbitrage opportunities between the electricity and the gas market are exploited, and a Storage & Balancing Case where the balancing markets (secondary reserve market for electricity, external balancing market for natural gas) are addressed. The optimal type and size of different centralized and decentralized storage facilities are determined and compared with each other. In a detailed sensitivity and cost analysis, we identify the key factors which could potentially improve the economic viability of the technological concepts assessed. We find that the P2G system used for bridging the balancing markets for power and gas cannot be operated profitably. For both, temporal arbitrage and balancing energy, pipe storage is preferred. Relatively high feed-in tariffs (100 € MW-1 for hydrogen, 130 € MW-1 for methane) are required to render pipe storage for P2G economically viable. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Soon after the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991, different research groups succeeded in filling carbon nanotubes with some elements, and, therefore, the question arose of filling carbon nanotubes with hydrogen by possibly using new effects such as nano-capillarity. Subsequently, very promising experiments claiming high hydrogen storage capacities in different carbon nanostructures initiated enormous research activity. Hydrogen storage capacities have been reported that exceed the benchmark for automotive application of 6.5 wt% set by the U.S. Department of Energy. However, the experimental data obtained with different methods for various carbon nanostructures show an extreme scatter. Classical calculations based on physisorption of hydrogen molecules could not explain the high storage capacities measured at ambient temperature, and, assuming chemisorption of hydrogen atoms, hydrogen release requires temperatures too high for technical applications. Up to now, only a few calculations and experiments indicate the possibility of an intermediate binding energy. Recently, serious doubt has arisen in relation to several key experiments, causing considerable controversy. Furthermore, high hydrogen storage capacities measured for carbon nanofibers did not survive cross-checking in different laboratories. Therefore, in light of today's knowledge, it is becoming less likely that at moderate pressures around room temperature carbon nanostructures can store the amount of hydrogen required for automotive applications.},

The fire characteristics of hydrogen, methane and gasoline, while different, do not largely favor the preferred use of any one of the three fuels; however, the threat of fuel-air explosions in confined spaces is greatest for hydrogen. Safety criteria for the storage of liquid hydrogen, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gasoline are compiled and presented. Gasoline is believed to be the easiest and perhaps the safest fuel to store because of its lower volatility and narrower flammable and detonable limits. It is concluded that all three fuels can be safely stored and used; however, the comparative safety and level of risk for each fuel will vary from one application to another. Generalized safety comparisons are made herein but detailed safety analyses will be required to establish the relative safety of different fuels for each specific fuel application and stipulated accident.

From the industrial point of view, the chemical vapor deposition process has shown advantages over laser ablation and electric-arc-discharge methods. The ultimate goal in nanotube synthesis should be to gain control over geometrical aspects of nanotubes, such as location and orientation, and the atomic structure of nanotubes, including helicity and diameter. There is currently no effective and simple purification procedure that fulfills all requirements for processing carbon nanotubes. Purification is still the bottleneck for technical applications, especially where large amounts of material are required. Although the alkali-metal-doped carbon nanotubes showed high H 2 weight uptake, further investigations indicated that some of this uptake was due to water rather than hydrogen. This discovery indicates a potential source of error in evaluation of the storage capacity of doped carbon nanotubes. Nevertheless, currently available single-wall nanotubes yield a hydrogen uptake value near 4 wt% under moderate pressure and room temperature. A further 50% increase is needed to meet U.S. Department of Energy targets for commercial exploitation. Meeting this target will require combining experimental and theoretical efforts to achieve a full understanding of the adsorption process, so that the uptake can be rationally optimized to commercially attractive levels. Large-scale production and purification of carbon nanotubes and remarkable improvement of H 2 storage capacity in carbon nanotubes represent significant technological and theoretical challenges in the years to come.},

	abstract = {The National Aerospace Plane (NASP) as currently conceived utilizes hydrogen as propellant. Hydrogen fuel, while possessing the advantages of high energy content per unit weight, rapid combustion kinetics for scramjet application, and a good heat sink for cooling the NASP's wings leading edge, also suffers from many disadvantages. These disadvantages include very low density, requiring large volume tankage and thus increased aircraft drag and reduced payload capacity, high fuel price, and 20 K cryogenic storage requirements, thus greatly complicating ground operations. Methane is a very cheap, clean burning fuel, with a density 7 times that of hydrogen and modest cryogenic (120 K) storage requirements. It would thus be highly advantageous if methane could be made to function as a fuel for the NASP. Such a possibility has been discounted in the past, however, because methane does not burn fast enough for efficient scramjet operation, and it possesses an inadequate thermal heat sink to effectively cool the drag heated surfaces of hypersonic NASP. In this paper a concept, termed the Methane-Acetylene Cycle Aerospace Plane (MACASP), will be proposed that has the potential of overcoming these difficulties. In the MACASP concept, methane fuel stored onboard the aircraft is run out within the wing leading edge in pipes which are allowed to rise in temperature to about 1400 K. in the presence of catalyst, the heat provided by wing drag is used to drive the highly endothermic chemical reaction; 2CH4 = 3H2 + C2H2. The products of this reaction, hydrogen and acetylene, are then fed into a combustion chamber and burned in air. As on the NASP, terminal acceleration to orbit beyond the critical Mach number of the scramjet can be enabled by rocket operation using a small on-board supply of LOx. The advantages of this concept are that the two highly energetic but difficult to store fuels (H2 and C2H2) can be used without on-board storage required. In effect, a portion of the large amount of energy being dissipated by the MACASP as aerodynamic drag is being recaptured and used to jack the methane up to an energy state where it has as high an energy content per unit mass and as rapid a combustion rate as hydrogen. The endothermic chemical reaction, which occurs on a millisecond time scale, actually endows the methane with a heat sink per unit mass almost as great as that possessed by liquid hydrogen. In this paper the thermodynamics of the MACASP concept is explored and theoretical feasibility is shown. Potential problems and areas of concern are identified. A conceptual point design for a MACASP vehicle is advanced and mission analysis performed comparing performance of the MACASP to both conventional hydrogen NASP and rocket driven expendable launch vehicles. It is shown that the MACASP concept offers significant promise for economical Earth to orbit transportation. © 1992 by Martin Marietta Corp.

	abstract = {Within 40 years the world will be depending heavily on three energy sources, which are all badly suited for distribution and consumer use. Load levelling and storage are uneconomical with nuclear power and especially with solar energy. With the exception of coal they are, however, clean and environmentally acceptable for large-scale use. The solution to this problem is to use a secondary energy-carrier system, which has to be able to connect economically scattered consumer locations to their supply centres. It will also have to provide a means of storage to smooth out demand and supply and also be compatible with the end-user requirements. Hydrogen is compatible with future energy sources, with other secondary energy carriers as well as with most end user requirements. This means it can easily be produced from water, the original energy being derived from either fossil fuels, e. g. nuclear, solar, geothermal, wind etc. Hydrogen energy can be transformed into electricity by fuel cells or generators coupled to gas turbines as well as regenerated from electricity by water electrolysis. It can be burned to yield hot water for district heating. End users can get electrical, mechanical, chemical or thermal energy from hydrogen by using fuel cells, internal-combustion engines, turbines, chemical reactors or burners. Hydrogen can be stored as a gas (bottled or underground), a liquid (cryogenic tanks) or in a solid form (metal hydrides). It can be distributed by the conventional and partly existing infrastructure of today's natural gas transportation and distribution pipe system with only minor modifications. The introduction of hydrogen as a main energy carrier is more an economic than a technical problem. Being a secondary energy carrier hydrogen will always be more expensive than the primary energy sources from which it has to be produced. It will play a major role only after the oil and gas era, which means after the year 2000. The earliest breakthroughs will occur in countries with no or few fossil energy resources and which have to turn to nuclear and solar energy first. After the year 2020, hydrogen will become a major energy carrier in many parts of the world.},

	abstract = {In this second part of a series on lunar industrialization and settlement the economically most promising energy technology is assessed as basis for subsequent energy discussions. The consumer sectors are habitats, transportation and production; the sources are nuclear and solar energy, used in variously processed forms. Habitats permit a relatively continuous growth in power level from small crew sizes of tens of persons (p) at about 2 kWe/p to hundreds and more with selenic agriculture at ∼ 10 kWe/p. Power requirements for transportation are affected, for a given transportation level, by evolution in the direction of minimal gas release into the lunar environment (to protect the industrially valuable high vacuum and for economic reasons) and by demands for suborbital transportation. The propellant ( O2 H2 propulsion) expended for ascent can be captured as steam in enclosed launch tracks and, unless used as water, the hydrogen extracted by electrolysis to minimize costly supply from Earth. For an annual delivery of 10,000 metric ton (t) net payload to circumlunar orbit (60 km) at 35 t during 286 24-hr periods, at least 2.6 t H2 per 24-hr needs to be extracted, requiring a continuous output of at least 5 MWe (laser-powered H2-drive in enclosed launch track would not require extraction of H2, but laser power levels in the order of hundreds of MWe are required, because the energy must be transferred in minutes). Power levels in the production sector depend on product and particular operating conditions. For, 10,000 t of beneficiated raw material or solar cells produced in 286 24-hr production periods/year, the nominally continuous power level may range from at least 2 MWe for the extraction of iron to some 55 MWe for the manufacturing of solar cells from lunar sand. The principal differences influencing the assessment of energy sources on the Moon and in orbit are the long lunar night, mitigating against solar power, and the abundance of natural shielding material. The solar power/mass is reduced significantly, due to the need for large-scale storage provisions, if energy supply is to be assured at night (a situation, not improved by the establishment of large laser power satellites at equidistant libration points to beam solar energy at lunar night). Lunar conditions are particularly favorable for the economic use of nuclear power. For power levels above ≲ 50 kWe and productive operation around the clock, nuclear power (with the exception of radioisotopes from nuclear waste) is superior to all solar alternatives. Less costly, unaffected by a large number of day/night temperature variations, by corpuscular radiation and micrometeorites, readily shielded by lunar topography in the vacuum on the surface, long operating life (≳ 7 yr) and not requiring energy storage, nuclear energy is the optimum power source both for industrial heat and electricity. © 1981.},
