	abstract = {Blending green hydrogen within the gas infrastructure is seen as the first move towards Europe's climate neutrality by 2050. Especially, Europe and North African have privileged role in energy cooperation sharing a woven and complex set of natural resources, knowledge, infrastructure, clear goals towards sustainable development. Developing common projects about hydrogen can mutually help both Europe and North Africa to achieve more sustainable, reliable and modern energy systems. This paper simulates the Greenstream gas corridor (connecting Libya to Italy) under increasing hydrogen blending scenarios using a transient and multi-component fluid-dynamic model of the gas transmission system. The additional compression energy required and the compressors’ operating hours are evaluated under the hypothesis that the energy content of the transported gas is maintained. The hydrogen profiles needed to generate the blends are obtained and used to optimally size a photovoltaic-powered electrolysis system, minimizing the compressed hydrogen storage. The results indicate that the additional energy costs of transporting hydrogen blends are up to 32.5% higher than natural gas transport, while negligibly impacting the overall efficiency of energy transport. The mismatch between solar hydrogen production and pipeline receiving potential highlights a challenge to be tackled to boost intersectoral integration. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is a viable clean energy source due to its high energy density and the fact that it burns without producing any carbon emissions. Nanostructured materials with tunable porosity have gathered significant attention for both hydrogen generation and hydrogen storage applications. This comprehensive review manuscript provides an in-depth overview of recent advancements in porosity tunability in nanostructures for hydrogen generation and hydrogen storage. With an emphasis on their porosity engineering tactics and their effects on hydrogen production efficiency and hydrogen storage capacity, it covers the synthesis procedures, characterization methodologies, and performance assessment of nanostructured materials. Sol-gel synthesis, hydrothermal synthesis, and chemical vapor deposition are the synthesis techniques covered in this paper. Through the careful control of nanostructured materials' size, shape, and composition, these techniques make it possible to precisely design porosity. These materials are characterized using methods like X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy to examine their crystal structure and shape. When evaluating the performance of nanostructured materials, methods like gas chromatography are used to estimate the efficiency of hydrogen generation, and gravimetric and volumetric measurements are used to determine the hydrogen storage capacity. Overall, understanding porosity engineering strategies and their impact on hydrogen generation and storage is crucial for the development of efficient and sustainable energy systems. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects in this field are discussed, aiming to guide future research and development efforts towards efficient and sustainable hydrogen production and storage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current study investigates suitable hydrogen storage technologies for hydrogen produced by renewable energy resources in a green manner. Type-I, III, and IV high-pressure tanks, adsorbent storage, metal hydride storage and chemical storage options are investigated and compared based on their hydrogen storage capacities, costs, masses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results of this study show that in a Type-IV hydrogen storage tank (i.e., composite material tank of carbon fiber with thermoplastic polymer liners), increasing the tank pressure from 100 bar to 800 bar increases the hydrogen holding capacity by 457.7%. Regarding the environmental impact, the lowest GHG emissions appear to be the lowest for liquid hydrogen storage with an average of 3.5 CO2eq/kg-H2 while the respective emissions become the highest in metal hydride storage tanks as 113.6 CO2eq/kg-H2. Furthermore, hydrogen storage capacity for Type-IV tanks varies from 1.94 kg at 100 bar to 15.69 kg at 1500 bar in a 250 L tank. In chemical hydride storage tanks, the stored H2 mass will be 40.75 kg for 100 L, 128.39 kg for 200 L, 216.03 kg for 300 L, 303.67 kg for 400 L, 391.31 kg for 500 L and 478.96 kg for 600 L, respectively. Moreover, hydrogen storage, distribution and dispensing are considered critically important in hydrogen logistics and the results of this study will help better guide policymakers to establish effective policies and increase renewable energy penetration in the energy market. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Over the past years, hydrogen has been identified as the most promising carrier of clean energy. In a world that aims to replace fossil fuels to mitigate greenhouse emissions and address other environmental concerns, hydrogen generation technologies have become a main player in the energy mix. Since hydrogen is the main working medium in fuel cells and hydrogen-based energy storage systems, integrating these systems with other renewable energy systems is becoming very feasible. For example, the coupling of wind or solar systems hydrogen fuel cells as secondary energy sources is proven to enhance grid stability and secure the reliable energy supply for all times. The current demand for clean energy is unprecedented, and it seems that hydrogen can meet such demand only when produced and stored in large quantities. This paper presents an overview of the main hydrogen production and storage technologies, along with their challenges. They are presented to help identify technologies that have sufficient potential for large-scale energy applications that rely on hydrogen. Producing hydrogen from water and fossil fuels and storing it in underground formations are the best large-scale production and storage technologies. However, the local conditions of a specific region play a key role in determining the most suited production and storage methods, and there might be a need to combine multiple strategies together to allow a significant large-scale production and storage of hydrogen. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The review presented herein is regarding the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) phenomena of carbon steel pipelines affected by the corrosive electrolytes that comes from external (E) and internal (I) environments, as well as the susceptibility and tensile stress on the SCC. Some useful tools are presented including essential aspects for determining and describing the E-SCC and I-SCC in oil and gas pipelines. Therefore, this study aims to present a comprehensive and critical review of a brief experimental summary, and a comparison of physicochemical, mechanical, and electrochemical data affecting external and internal SCC in carbon steel pipelines exposed to corrosive media have been conducted. The SCC, hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC), hydrogen embrittlement, and sulfide stress cracking (SSC) are attributed to the pH, and to hydrogen becoming more corrosive by combining external and internal sources promoting cracking, such as sulfide compounds, acidic soils, acidic atmospheric compounds, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, organic acids (acetic acid, mainly), bacteria induced corrosion, cathodic polarization, among others. SCC growth is a reaction between the microstructural, chemical, and mechanical effects and it depends on the external and internal environmental sources promoting unpredictable cracks and fractures. In some cases, E-SCC could be initiated by hydrogen that comes from the over-voltage during the cathodic protection processes. I-SCC could be activated by over-operating pressure and temperature at flowing media during the production, gathering, storage and transportation of wet hydrocarbons through pipelines. The mechanical properties related to I-SCC were higher in comparison with those reviewed by E-SCC, suggesting that pipelines suffer more susceptibility to I-SCC. When a pipeline is designed, the internal fluid being transported (changes of environments) and the external environment concerning SCC should be considered. This review offers a good starting point for newcomers into the field, it is written as a tutorial, and covers a large number of basic standards in the area. © 2020, MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

The harmonic response laws of drillstring is discussed. Harmonic response analysis includes non-failure case and failure case. Absorber control measure is simulated to lower vibration amplitude of drillstring. The drill string collides violently with the wellbore reduces the wellbore quality and increases the unreliability of the HUS. Lateral harmonic response has the greatest damage to well wall. Torsional harmonic response causes less damage than lateral vibration. High WOB (weight on bit) and high RPM (rotary per minute) are not conducive to the quality of HUS.

	abstract = {Salt caverns are extensively utilized for storing various substances such as fossil energy, hydrogen, compressed air, nuclear waste, and industrial solid waste. In China, when the salt cavern is leached through single-well water solution mining with oil as a cushion, engineering challenges arise with the leaching tubing, leading to issues like damage and instability. These problems significantly hinder the progress of cavern construction and the control of cavern shape. The primary cause of this is the flow-induced vibration instability of leaching tubing within a confined space, which results in severe bending or damage to the tubing. This study presents a model experimental investigation on the dynamic characteristics of leaching tubing using a self-developed liquid-solid coupling physical model experiment apparatus. The experiment utilizes a silicone-rubber pipe (SRP) and a polycarbonate pipe (PCP) to examine the effects of various factors on the dynamic stability of cantilevered pipes conveying fluid. These factors include external space constraint, flexural rigidity, medium outside the pipe, overhanging length, and end conditions. The experiments reveal four dynamic response phenomena: water hammer, static buckling, chaotic motion, and flutter instability. The study further demonstrates that the length of the external space constraint has a direct impact on the flutter critical flow velocity of the cantilevered pipe conveying fluid. Additionally, the flutter critical flow velocity is influenced by the end conditions and different external media. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Global energy consumption is expected to reach 911 BTU by the end of 2050 as a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization. Hydrogen is increasingly recognized as a clean and reliable energy vector for decarbonization and defossilization across various sectors. Projections indicate a significant rise in global demand for hydrogen, underscoring the need for sustainable production, efficient storage, and utilization. In this state-of-the-art review, we explore hydrogen production methods, compare their environmental impacts through life cycle analysis, delve into geological storage options, and discuss hydrogen’s potential as a future transportation fuel. Combining electrolysis to make hydrogen and storing it in porous underground materials like salt caverns and geological reservoirs looks like a good way to balance out the variable supply of renewable energy and meet the demand at peak times. Hydrogen is a key component of our sustainable economy, and this article gives a broad overview of the process from production to consumption, touching on technical, economic, and environmental concerns along the way. We have made an attempt in this paper to compile different methods for the production of hydrogen and its storage, the challenges faced by current methods in the manufacturing of hydrogen gas, and the role of hydrogen in the future. This review paper will serve as a very good reference for hydrogen system engineering applications. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future research to help improve the technological efficiency of certain production methods, all with the goal of scaling up the hydrogen economy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Recently, interest in developing H2 strategies with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies has surged. Considering that, this paper reviews recent literature on blue H2, a potential low-carbon, short-term solution during the H2 transition period. Three key aspects were the focus of this paper. First, it presents the processes used for blue H2 production. Second, it presents a detailed comparison between blue H2 and natural gas as fuels and energy carriers. The third aspect focuses on CO2 sequestration in depleted natural gas reservoirs, an essential step for implementing blue H2. Globally, ∼ 75% of H2 is produced using steam methane reforming, which requires CCS to obtain blue H2. Currently, blue H2 needs to compete with other advancing technologies such as green H2, solar power, battery storage, etc. Compared to natural gas and liquefied natural gas, blue H2 gas results in lower CO2 emissions since CCS is applied. However, transporting liquefied and compressed blue H2 entails higher energy, economic, and environmental costs. CCS must be appropriately implemented to produce blue H2 successfully. Due to their established capacity to trap hydrocarbons over geologic time scales, depleted natural gas reservoirs are regarded as a viable option for CCS. Such a conclusion is supported by several simulation studies and field projects in many countries. Additionally, there is much field experience and knowledge on the injection and production performance of natural gas reservoirs. Therefore, using the existing site infrastructure, converting these formations into storage reservoirs is undemanding. © 2023 The Authors},

Herein, an updated assessment of progress recorded on the production, transportation, utilization, and storage of hydrogen is examined. Firstly, the numerous routes for the production of hydrogen from renewable and non-renewable sources are systematically demystified. Subsequently, the transportation framework for hydrogen is discussed. Moreover, the industrial application of hydrogen is elucidated and the existing hydrogen storage systems are chronologically analyzed. From the review of the literature, photocatalytic water splitting technology is the most environmentally benign method available for H2 production. Additionally, underground hydrogen storage in a geologic porous medium offers the largest and most affordable storage capacity for H2 gas. Nonetheless, the compatibility of H2 with reservoir fluid in porous media and other safety concerns has to be adequately understood to avoid preventable losses. Finally, the key research gaps were highlighted and potential areas for future research are proffered. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Hydrogen storage in underground pipes is more economical than in geological caverns for useable amounts <20-t-H2. However, because the pipe material is a major cost factor, the capital and operating costs for this storage method do not decrease appreciably with an increase in the amount of stored H2. Unlike underground pipes, the installed capital cost of salt caverns decreases appreciably from ~$95/kg-H2 at 100 t-H2 stored to <$19/kg-H2 at 3000 t-H2 stored. Over the same scale, the annual storage cost decreases from ~$17/kg-H2 to ~$3/kg-H2. Like salt caverns, the installed capital cost of lined rock caverns decreases from ~$160/kg-H2 at 100 t-H2 stored to <$44/kg-H2 at 3000 t-H2 stored. Storing >750-t useable H2 requires multiple caverns. The cost of salt caverns scales more favorably with size because the salt caverns are larger than lined rock caverns and need to be added at a slower rate as the storage capacity is increased. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), comprising: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain, is home to an abundant number of resources, including natural gas and solar and wind energy (renewables). Because of this, the region is favourably positioned to become a significant player in both blue and green hydrogen production and their export. Current dependence on fossil fuels and ambitious national targets for decarbonisation have led the region and world to research the feasibility of switching to a hydrogen economy. This literature review critically examines the current advantages and strategies adopted by the GCC to expedite the implementation of hydrogen supply chains, as well as investigation into the methodologies employed in current research for the modelling and optimisation of hydrogen supply chains. Insight into these endeavours is critical for stakeholders to assess the inherent challenges and opportunities in establishing a sustainable hydrogen economy. Despite a substantial global effort, establishing a solid hydrogen supply chain presently faces various obstacles, including the costs of clean hydrogen production. Scaling-up storage and transport methods is an issue that affects all types of hydrogen, including carbon-intensive (grey) hydrogen. However, the current costs of green hydrogen production, mostly via the process of electrolysis, is a major obstacle hindering the widescale deployment of clean hydrogen. Research in this literature review found that compressed gas and cryogenic liquid options have the highest storage capacities for hydrogen of 39.2 and 70.9 kg/m3, respectively. Meanwhile, for hydrogen transportation, pipelines and cryogenic tankers are the most conventional and efficient options, with an efficiency of over 99 %. Cryogenic ships to carry liquid hydrogen also show potential due to their large storage capacities of 10,000 tonnes per shipment, However, costs per vessel are currently still very expensive, ranging between $ 465 and $620 million. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {There is no doubt that greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2, needs to be reduced to mitigate the effects of climate change. While carbon management can be achieved through a number of technological and engineering approaches ranging from energy efficiency (i.e., highly energy integrated system and process intensification) to renewable energy (wind, solar, hydrogen), CO2 capture & storage (CCS) has been identified as having a key role in the energy transition. Captured anthropogenic CO2 can be permanently stored in saline aquifers and depleted reservoirs. Saline aquifers (normally unsuitable for industrial or human exploitation) offer the largest storage capacity; however, there is, usually, lack of geological characterization leading to high risks due to large uncertainty. On the other hand, depleted gas fields, close to economical life cessation, are deemed an excellent alternative as safe and long-term storage is already proven and immense geological characterisation has been gathered during production life. Moreover, there is great potential to repurpose the existing offshore infrastructure (pipelines, platforms, and wells) as to minimize capital expenditure and delaying decommissioning costs. Repurposing existing production systems can also be an efficient way to achieve rapid deployment of CCS at large scale. In this paper, we present the key engineering challenges, risks, and opportunities in the re-use of existing oil and gas offshore infrastructure for CO2 transport and injection. We highlight the complex operational constraints and interactions between different components of the transportation network. The design and operation of the transportation network is governed by the following drivers: • Safe design • Robust and flexible operation • Minimize cost (or delay expenditure as long as possible) • Minimize emissions of greenhouse gases associated to the operation of the transport network (i.e., energy efficiency) • Start operation with minimum modifications.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is one of the main energy carriers playing a prominent role in the future decarbonization of the economy. However, several aspects regarding the transport and storage of this gas are challenging. The intermediary conversion of hydrogen into high-density energy molecules may be a crucial step until technological conditions are ready to attain a significant reduction in fossil fuel use in transport and the industrial sector. The process of transforming hydrogen into methane by anaerobic digestion is reviewed, showing that this technology is a feasible option for facilitating hydrogen storage and transport. The manuscript focuses on the role of anaerobic digestion as a technology driver capable of fast adaptation to current energy needs. The use of thermophilic systems and reactors capable of increasing the contact between the H2-fuel and liquid phase demonstrated outstanding capabilities, attaining higher conversion rates and increasing methane productivity. Pressure is a relevant factor of the process, allowing for better hydrogen solubility and setting the basis for considering feasible underground hydrogen storage concomitant with biological methanation. This feature may allow the integration of sequestered carbon dioxide as a relevant substrate. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of renewable energies has the potential to decarbonize the electricity supply. This is more challenging in difficult-to-electrify sectors. The use of hydrogen provides a massive potential for this issue. However, expanding hydrogen production increases electricity demand while providing additional flexibility to the electricity market. This paper mainly aims to analyze the economic effects of this sector coupling between the European electricity and national hydrogen markets. The developed energy market model jointly considers both markets to reach an overall welfare optimum. A novel modeling approach allows the interaction of these markets without the need for several iterative optimization runs. This allows for a detailed analysis of various market participants’ changes in consumer and producer surpluses. The optimization is conducted in 13 connected Central European countries to account for various power plant fleets, generation mixes, and electricity prices. Results show an overall welfare increase of EUR 4 to 28 billion in 2030 and an EUR 5 to 158 billion increase in 2040. However, there is a surplus shift from consumers to producers. The consumer surplus is reduced by up to EUR 44 billion in 2030 and EUR 60 billion while producers benefit to achieve the overall welfare benefits. The reduction of consumer surplus changes if significant price peaks occur. Fuel cell applications can avoid these price peaks, resulting in a surplus shift from thermal power plants to consumers. Hence, consumer surplus can increase by up to EUR 146 billion in the respective 2040 scenarios. Pink hydrogen accounts for a sizable portion of total hydrogen production, up to 58 percent in 2030 and up to 30 percent in 2040. As a result, nuclear power plants that are nearly entirely allocated in France stand to benefit greatly from this sector coupling. Additional efforts could be made to address the link between hydrogen and natural gas prices. Furthermore, the potential for cross-border hydrogen trade and the implementation of national legal and regulatory frameworks could be assessed. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Liquid hydrogen has potential as a storage vector for large-scale hydrogen transportation. Hydrogen liquefaction is however a highly energy intensive process, particularly due to the necessary exothermic spin-isomer conversion from ortho- to parahydrogen. We explore the operation of the main cryogenic plate-fin heat-exchangers (PFHXs) used in hydrogen liquefaction; simultaneous dynamic processes occurring within the PFHX include the heterogeneously catalysed spin-isomer conversion, heat transfer and pressure loss. In this work, these coupled processes are simulated for a 100 tonne/day hydrogen reactant cooled by a helium refrigerant in a PFHX. For the process configuration utilised in this work, a reactor volume of 24.0 m3 and a coolant flow rate of 600 tonne/day were necessary to achieve and outlet parahydrogen fraction of 0.99. Pressure drop through the PFHX packed bed was consistently negligible. We also explored the sensitivity towards model parameters. The outlet parahydrogen fraction is determined to be considerably (∼10 times) more sensitive to reaction rate kinetics relative to heat transfer: therefore, the reactor geometry will be primarily determined by conversion kinetics. The current quantitative understanding of these rate kinetics is however limited. Future experimental research thus needs to focus on quantifying ortho- to parahydrogen kinetics.

	abstract = {Laves phases with their comparably simple crystal structure are very common intermetallic phases and can be formed from element combinations all over the periodic table resulting in a huge number of known examples. Even though this type of phases is known for almost 100 years, and although a lot of information on stability, structure, and properties has accumulated especially during the last about 20 years, systematic evaluation and rationalization of this information in particular as a function of the involved elements is often lacking. It is one of the two main goals of this review to summarize the knowledge for some selected respective topics with a certain focus on non-stoichiometric, i.e., non-ideal Laves phases. The second, central goal of the review is to give a systematic overview about the role of Laves phases in all kinds of materials for functional and structural applications. There is a surprisingly broad range of successful utilization of Laves phases in functional applications comprising Laves phases as hydrogen storage material (Hydraloy), as magneto-mechanical sensors and actuators (Terfenol), or for wear- and corrosion-resistant coatings in corrosive atmospheres and at high temperatures (Tribaloy), to name but a few. Regarding structural applications, there is a renewed interest in using Laves phases for creep-strengthening of high-temperature steels and new respective alloy design concepts were developed and successfully tested. Apart from steels, Laves phases also occur in various other kinds of structural materials sometimes effectively improving properties, but often also acting in a detrimental way. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Wellbore decommissioning is the final stage in the life cycle of any oil or gas well and involves placing acceptable well barriers to seal the wellbore. Operators have the obligation to decommission wells safely once they reach the end of their life. This study explores the prospects of repurposing near-to-decommission wellbores for pipe storage, forming a hydrogen-based energy storage system for containing hydrogen produced from surplus renewable electricity. It offers two pathways for hydrogen consumption, 1) Power-to-Hydrogen and 2) Power-to-Power. A conceptual design is presented to repurpose a wellbore into pipe storage to store hydrogen in its gaseous form. The storability of the pipe depends on pipe characteristics, including diameter and length as well as working pressure. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to calculate levelized cost of storage (LCOS) and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) for the proposed method. The LCOS is in the range of 1.33 A$/(kgH2) and 1.66 A$/(kgH2). LCOH including the storage cost is obtained to be in the range of 5.22 A$/(kgH2) and 6.50 A$/(kgH2). This system can potentially integrate green hydrogen into local economies by managing decommissioning costs for the creation of a storage solution for green hydrogen. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Geological hydrogen storage in depleted hydrocarbon fields is an emerging technology aimed at mitigating climate change. This review paper delves into the geological storage of hydrogen in depleted gas and oil reservoirs, focusing on using geopolymer cement as a pioneering solution to ensure the integrity and safety of wellbores during hydrogen storage within the oil and gas industry. Geopolymer cement, an innovative alternative to traditional Portland cement, exhibits remarkable mechanical strength and durability, making it capable of withstanding extreme loading conditions and chemical degradation. Its lower permeability further ensures secure hydrogen containment within the reservoir, minimizing leaks and environmental risks. Numerous studies have investigated the suitability of geopolymers for wellbore applications, highlighting their long-term durability, CO2 permeability control, mechanical robustness, self-healing properties, and chemical stability. The paper underscores the significance of these attributes in safeguarding wellbore structures under challenging downhole conditions, such as corrosive environments and high temperatures and pressures. While emphasizing the advantages of geopolymers, it acknowledges the need for further research and optimization in areas like mix compositions, scalability, and environmental impact. The future of geopolymers in wellbores for hydrogen storage holds great promise. Collaboration among stakeholders and regulatory bodies will be pivotal in realizing the potential of geopolymers and advancing clean energy technologies for a sustainable energy future. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS), especially in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is becoming increasingly attractive as a solution to H2 large-scale seasonal storage but there are several concerns regarding the repurposing of existing structures due to hydrogen detrimental effects on materials. This article aims to provide insight into the wellbore integrity challenges associated with UHS in depleted reservoirs. It briefly discusses past and current experiences of UHS. To identify knowledge gaps and technical barriers, an overview of wellbore integrity issues that could be encountered during UHS projects in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is presented. Since wellbore integrity issues lead to fluid migration, published work on leakage rate estimation and risk evaluation in storage projects are also discussed. Field wellbore integrity evaluation methods and analytical models are discussed as well as current potential site criteria for the UHS selection site. Based on the review, leakage through the injection and legacy wells are primary concerns on UHS projects. Wellbore integrity can be affected by hydrogen damage, microbial-induced corrosion and corrosion processes on metallic materials, cement degradation due to hydrogen and corrosive agents exposure, and the severe conditions to which the materials are exposed through the wellbore life. In addition, the existence of legacy wells in poor conditions represents a risk to the safety of UHS projects. Future works were recommended to better comprehend hydrogen damage processes, hydrogen interaction with casing, cement, and subsurface microbiological processes, and to establish multi-criteria selection methods for potential sites. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The interaction of hydrogen in shale gas formations holds significant interest for long-term subsurface hydrogen storage. Accurately and rapidly predicting hydrogen adsorption in these formations is crucial for assessing underground hydrogen storage potential. Many laboratory experiments and molecular simulations have been conducted to determine hydrogen adsorption. However, laboratory experiments and molecular simulations require complex setups and extensive calculations, which can be time-consuming. Consequently, end-users may prefer quick and accurate prediction of hydrogen adsorption to reduce the experimental and computational burden. This study introduces a novel model for predicting hydrogen adsorption using gradient boosting regression and available molecular simulation data from the literature. The data-driven model predicts hydrogen adsorption on kerogen structures based on pressure, temperature, adsorbed methane, hydrogen-to‑carbon ratio, oxygen-to‑carbon ratio, and kerogen density. We compared gradient-boosting regression with other machine learning tools, including artificial neural networks, symbolic regression assisted with genetic programming, decision trees, and random forests in terms of their capability to predict H2 adsorption on shale kerogen. A simple mathematical equation based on symbolic regression via genetic programming has also been provided, with training and testing coefficients of determination of 88.4% and 85.8%, respectively. However, the digital model created using gradient boosting regression outperformed all other machine learning tools, achieving a coefficient of determination of 99.6% for training data and 94.6% for testing data. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted that demonstrates the robustness of the developed model. In the case of kerogen type A, the order of increasing hydrogen adsorption is KIA < KIIA<KIIIA. Conversely, for kerogen type B, the trend is KIIA<KIIC<KIIB<KIID in terms of increasing hydrogen adsorption. This developed digital model offers higher prediction accuracy and finds applications in storing hydrogen in shale gas formations. The proposed model offers a substantial time-saving advantage in predicting hydrogen adsorption compared to laborious and time-consuming laboratory experiments and/or molecular simulations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy represents a crucial pathway towards achieving carbon neutrality and is a pivotal facet of future strategic emerging industries. The safe and efficient transportation of hydrogen is a key link in the entire chain development of the hydrogen energy industry’s “production, storage, and transportation”. Mixing hydrogen into natural gas pipelines for transportation is the potential best way to achieve large-scale, long-distance, safe, and efficient hydrogen transportation. Welds are identified as the vulnerable points in natural gas pipelines, and compatibility between hydrogen-doped natural gas and existing pipeline welds is a critical technical challenge that affects the global-scale transportation of hydrogen energy. Therefore, this article systematically discusses the construction and weld characteristics of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines, the research status of hydrogen damage mechanism, and mechanical property strengthening methods of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds, and points out the future development direction of hydrogen damage mechanism research in hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds. The research results show that: ① Currently, there is a need for comprehensive research on the degradation of mechanical properties in welds made from typical pipe materials on a global scale. It is imperative to systematically elucidate the mechanism of mechanical property degradation due to conventional and hydrogen-induced damage in welds of high-pressure hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines worldwide. ② The deterioration of mechanical properties in welds of hydrogen-doped natural gas pipelines is influenced by various components, including hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. It is necessary to reveal the mechanism of mechanical property deterioration of pipeline welds under the joint participation of multiple damage mechanisms under multi-component gas conditions. ③ Establishing a fundamental database of mechanical properties for typical pipeline steel materials under hydrogen-doped natural gas conditions globally is imperative, to form a method for strengthening the mechanical properties of typical high-pressure hydrogen-doped natural gas pipeline welds. ④ It is essential to promptly develop relevant standards for hydrogen blending transportation, welding technology, as well as weld evaluation, testing, and repair procedures for natural gas pipelines. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Future national electricity, heating, cooling and transport systems need to reach zero emissions. Significant numbers of back-up power plants as well as large-scale energy storage capacity are required to guarantee the reliability of energy supply in 100 percent renewable energy systems. Electricity can be partially converted into hydrogen, which can be transported via pipelines, stored in large quantities in underground salt caverns to overcome seasonal effects and used as electricity storage or as a clean fuel for transport. The question addressed in this paper is how parked and grid-connected hydrogen-fueled Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles might balance 100 per cent renewable electricity, heating, cooling and transport systems at the national level in Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, France and Spain? Five national electricity, heating, cooling and transport systems are modeled for the year 2050 for the five countries, assuming only 50 percent of the passenger cars to be grid-connected Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles, the remaining Battery Electric Vehicles. The grid-connected Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle fleet can always balance the energy systems and their usage is low, having load factors of 2.1–5.5 percent, corresponding to an average use of 190–480 h per car, per year. At peak times, occurring only a few hours per year, 26 to 43 percent of the grid-connected Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle are required and in particular for energy systems with high shares of solar energy, such as Spain, balancing by grid-connected Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles is mainly required during the night, which matches favorably with driving usage. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In order to realize the large-scale and normal implementation of power-to-gas technology, as well as the large-capacity storage and long-distance transportation of gas in the later stage of electric hydrogen production, a power-to-gas technology with real-time energy conversion characteristics and large-scale energy storage characteristics is studied in this paper. Firstly, the water-electricity-gas coupling process between the electrolytic cell and the methanation reactor in the power-to-gas system is discussed in detail, and the model of the power-to-gas system based on the coordination of real-time energy conversion and large-scale energy storage is proposed. Then, based on a multi-energy coupling regional integrated energy system, a highly decoupled multi-step modelling method is adopted to construct its optimal operation model, and the equivalent variable substitution method is used to transform it into a linear programming problem. Finally, the calculation results show that the proposed power-to-gas technology can further improve the energy utilization efficiency due to the complementary characteristics of the two functions, so as to effectively promote the implementation of large-scale power-to-gas projects in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Magnesium hydrides (MgH2) have attracted extensive attention as solid-state H2 storage, owing to their low cost, abundance, excellent reversibility, and high H2 storage capacity. This review comprehensively explores the synthesis and performance of Mg-based alloys. Several factors affecting their hydrogen storage performance were also reviewed. The metals addition led to destabilization of Mg–H bonds to boost the dehydrogenation process. A unique morphology could provide more available active sites for the dissociation/recombination of H2 and allow the activation energy reduction. Also, an appropriate support prevent the agglomeration of Mg particles, hence, sustains their nanosize particles. Moreover, the perspective of avenues for future research presented in this review is expected to act as a guide for the development of novel Mg-based H2 storage systems. New morphological shape of catalysts, more unexplored and highly potential waste materials, and numerous synthesis procedures should be explored to further enhance the H2 storage of Mg-based alloys. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

As well as considering the numerous benefits of the realization of underground hydrogen storage (UHS), such as high energy densities, low leakage rates and big storage volumes, risk analysis of UHS is a required step for assessing the suitability of this technology. In this work, a preliminary quantitative risk assessment (QRA) was performed by starting from the worst-case scenario: rupture at the ground of the riser pipe from the salt cavern to the ground. The influence of hydrogen contamination by bacterial metabolism was studied, considering the composition of the gas contained in the salt caverns as time variable. A bow-tie analysis was used to highlight all the possible causes (basic events) as well as the outcomes (jet fire, unconfined vapor cloud explosion (UVCE), toxic chemical release), and then, consequence and risk analyses were performed. The results showed that a UVCE is the most frequent outcome, but its effect zone decreases with time due to the hydrogen contamination and the higher contents of methane and hydrogen sulfide. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Large scale of hydrogen storage is needed to balance the energy supply-demand fluctuation issues. Among few of the large scale storage systems, depleted oil and gas wells are widely employed. The construction of wellbore is normally in cylindrical shape and formed by layers of cement, casing and formation. As failure of wellbore is costly, proper structural integrity assessment is essential. In this article, an analytical solution derived based on recursive algorithm for estimating the thermomechanical stresses across the wellbore structure was proposed and verified. The temperature and stresses distribution results obtained from proposed analytical solution were compared with numerical results and they were found in good agreement. The percentage of difference was observed to be less than 0.1%. Besides that, a comparison study was performed on two, four and six layers wellbore structure. It was observed that four and six layers structure can produce much lower tangential tensile stress on the steel casing of the wellbore © 2022. Published by Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz},

This paper focuses on the large-scale compressed hydrogen storage options with respect to three categories: storage vessels, geological storage, and other underground storage alternatives. In this study, we investigated a wide variety of compressed hydrogen storage technologies, discussing in fair detail their theory of operation, potential, and challenges. The analysis confirms that a techno-economic chain analysis is required to evaluate the viability of one storage option over another for a case by case. Some of the discussed technologies are immature; however, this does not rule out these technologies; rather, it portrays the research opportunities in the field and the foreseen potential of these technologies.

	abstract = {Hydrogen, as a clean and efficient energy source, is important in achieving zero-CO2 targets. This paper explores the potential of hydrogen geologic storage (HGS) in China for large-scale energy storage, crucial for stabilizing intermittent renewable energy sources and managing peak demand. Despite its promise, HGS faces challenges due to hydrogen's low density and viscosity, and its complex interactions with geological formations and microorganisms. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the current research status for HGS, with a particular focus on highlighting the main challenges confronting China. These difficulties and challenges primarily arise from complex geological conditions and the absence of fundamental parameters within potential reservoirs, including depleted oil/gas fields, salt caverns, and brine aquifers. Additionally, we have synthesized the current applications of machine learning (ML)as a potential solution. Key challenges are examined, such as the effects of operational parameters (e.g., cyclical injection-production and injection rates) on HGS efficiency, which can influence phenomena such as hydrogen fingering and caprock integrity. This review also looks into the insufficiently understood hydrogen-water-rock geochemical reactions under diverse temperatures and pressures, a gap that hampers the development of predictive numerical simulations and raises concerns about hydrogen leakage due to changes in porosity and permeability. Additionally, the paper addresses the limited knowledge about the metabolic mechanisms of subsurface microorganisms under extreme conditions, highlighting potential risks of hydrogen leakage and groundwater contamination. These microorganisms can metabolize hydrogen, producing gases such as CH4 and H2S, which may cause steel corrosion. Furthermore, the study assesses the distribution and prospects of three primary methods for pure hydrogen storage in China, considering the current state of hydrogen development and relevant government policies. The role of ML in advancing HGS is also discussed, offering insights into future research directions. This review not only scrutinizes the scientific challenges of HGS but also underscores its potential, guiding future simulation and practical engineering applications in this field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy, characterized by its high calorific value and sustainability, represents a secondary clean energy source. It is predominantly stored, transported, and utilized through pipeline networks. However, a comprehensive optimization approach for the design for the ground pipeline network of hydrogen storage is currently lacking. This paper embarks on a systematic exploration of the layout, station type and parameter design for the ground pipeline network of hydrogen storage. Addressing various application perspectives, the study constructs two distinct pipeline network structures: the Star-Star Global Optimization Model (SSGO-Model) and the Star-Tree Global Optimization Model (STGO-Model). Three cases are discussed under six different constraint scenarios. These scenarios focus on layout optimization, variable capacity layout optimization, and the overall optimization of layout and parameters. An overall optimization strategy is proposed to solve the models. A detailed analysis of the iteration process, layout schemes, station and pipeline constraints, investment, and flow parameters of the pipeline network in the optimization results is presented. Through systematic analysis, the correctness and effectiveness of the model are verified, demonstrating the variability of optimization results under different topological structures and constraint conditions. Moreover, when conducting integrated optimization, the total investment is minimized, proving its superiority. The findings demonstrate the applicability of these models in guiding the construction for the ground pipeline network of hydrogen storage, thereby fostering the advancement of hydrogen storage technology. Concurrently, this research contributes significantly to the development of hydrogen energy, offering strategic insights and practical solutions for its efficient deployment. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen plays a major role in the net-zero greenhouse gas-reduction strategy of the European Union. To supply hydrogen as cheap as possible, a well-balanced production system is needed to handle fluctuations of solar radiation and wind energy. Thus, this paper investigates the onsite hydrogen supply costs in the European catchment area in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050. Furthermore, a subsequent transport per pipeline to one of the projected demand centres in Europe (exemplary Germany) is considered. Also, the sensitivity regarding the additional use of salt caverns as hydrogen storage and less restricting supply profiles is assessed as well as the technical annual supply potential for 2030 and 2050. To do so, the optimal system design for minimized hydrogen supply cost for water electrolysis based on photovoltaic and wind turbines is estimated for a 0.5° x 0.5° grid using a linear optimization model. For the best locations, coastal regions at the North Sea, Western Sahara and parts of Algeria, onsite hydrogen supply cost decreases from 3 €2020/kgH2 in 2030 to 2 €2020/kgH2 in 2050. The technical hydrogen supply potential is tremendous, especially from Northern Africa, and a supply to Central Europe (Germany) via pipeline for around 3 €2020/kgH2 is possible in 2050, while a domestic hydrogen production in Germany covering the projected demand would lead to cost up to 4.5 €2020/kgH2. Furthermore, a large scale hydrogen storage e.g. in salt caverns, can reduce the hydrogen supply costs for regions with high seasonality of solar and wind up to 50% and excess electricity to less than 10%, leading to fewer cost deviations between the sub-regions, resulting in lower import costs from Northern and Western Europe than from Northern Africa or Middle East. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Producing Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) via Power-to-Gas (PtG) is favourable for two reasons; it can be substituted for natural gas in the gas network, and it enables CO2 recycling as energy systems transition towards a low-carbon future. However, the expensive SNG production process is a barrier to being cost-competitive with other market gases. Several diverse factors influence SNG production cost, which results in several possible process configurations with varying performance which influence it. The hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) required to produce SNG are available from multiple sources, while the SNG production cost is also influenced by the capital investment required for PtG process units, interim storage facilities, and operating expenses. Hence, an in-depth analysis of the factors affecting SNG production is required to understand their effect on the cost and to provide information on cost savings, economic implications, and optimal SNG production setup for decision-makers. In this paper, an optimisation algorithm is developed to model the PtG process units. The main objective of this work is to determine optimal process configurations for SNG production by analysing its influencing cost factors. A factorial design approach is integrated into the optimisation process to minimise the production cost by choosing the cost-effective process configurations. This work also determines the factors with a significant influence on the production cost using an ANOVA. The algorithm identifies the cost-effective H2 and CO2 source to obtain the least expensive SNG production setup. Based on the values of the cost factors, strategies for lowering the production cost in an existing setup are identified. The factors with the most influence on the SNG production cost are the capacity and capex of the methanator unit © 2021 The Authors},

Here, we identify and characterize 60 natural hydrogen seeps as analogues for potential leakage from engineered storage reservoirs to consider implications for monitoring. We report and compare the geological and environmental setting; seepage mode (dry gas/ associated with water); co-released gases; seep rates and areal fluxes; temporal variation; seep structure; gas source; and composition. Seep characteristics are determined by local geological and hydrological conditions, specifically whether hydrogen gas is seeping through soils and unconsolidated sediments, fractured bedrock or into water. Hydrogen is typically co-emitted with other gases (CO2,CH4,N2) with CH4, the most common co-emitted gas. The structural controls on seep location and characteristics are similar between hydrogen and CO2 seeps. However, compared to CO2, hydrogen is more readily dispersed when mixing with air and hydrogen is more prone to being consumed or transformed via biotic or abiotic reactions, and so the quantity of leaked hydrogen can be greatly attenuated before seeping. Monitoring approaches should therefore be tailored to the local geology and hydrological conditions, and monitoring approaches to detect hydrogen and associated gases would be appropriate. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The world is undergoing a substantial energy transition with an increasing share of intermittent sources of energy on the grid, which is increasing the challenges to operate the power grid reliably. An option that has been receiving much focus after the COVID pandemic is the development of a hydrogen economy. Challenges for a hydrogen economy are the high investment costs involved in compression, storage, and long-distance transportation. This paper analyses an innovative proposal for the creation of hydrogen ocean links. It intends to fill existing gaps in the creation of a hydrogen economy with the increase in flexibility and viability for hydrogen production, consumption, compression, storage, and transportation. The main concept behind the proposals presented in this paper consists of using the fact that the pressure in the deep sea is very high, which allows a thin and cheap HDPE tank to store and transport large amounts of pressurized hydrogen in the deep sea. This is performed by replacing seawater with pressurized hydrogen and maintaining the pressure in the pipes similar to the outside pressure.

Notable investment is directed toward hydrogen research and material innovation for transmission, storage, fuel cells, and sensors. Ensuring safe and dependable hydrogen facilities is paramount, given the challenges in accident control. Addressing material compatibility issues within hydrogen systems remains a critical focus. Challenges, roadmaps, and scenarios steer long-term planning and technology outlooks. Strategic visions align actions and policies, encompassing societal and ecological dimensions. The confluence of hydrogen’s promise with material progress holds the prospect of reshaping our energy landscape sustainably. Forming collective future perspectives to foresee this emerging technology’s potential benefits is valuable. Our review article comprehensively explores the forthcoming challenges in hydrogen technology. We extensively examine the challenges and opportunities associated with hydrogen production, incorporating CO2 capture technology. Furthermore, the interaction of materials and composites with hydrogen, particularly in the context of hydrogen transmission, pipeline, and infrastructure, are discussed to understand the interplay between materials and hydrogen dynamics. Additionally, the exploration extends to the embrittlement phenomena during storage and transmission, coupled with a comprehensive examination of the advancements and hurdles intrinsic to hydrogen fuel cells. Finally, our exploration encompasses addressing hydrogen safety from an industrial perspective.

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this research is to carry out a literature review on the use of life-cycle cost (LCC) approaches for hydrogen technologies, by analysing its evolution over a decade (2012–2021). Methods: The SCOPUS database has been used to select relevant literature on the subject. After adoption of inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 67 papers were selected for our review. Then, we analysed these studies in terms of hydrogen technologies (fuel cells, electrolysers, hydrogen storage approach, etc.) covered by the LCC approaches. In addition, we also performed an analysis of the LCC features — type of LCC (conventional, environmental, social), integration with LCA/S-LCA, guidelines followed, system boundaries (cradle-to-farm gate, cradle-to-consumer, cradle-to-grave, cradle-to-cradle), functional units, financial tools (NPV, BEP, etc.), type of costs included, and life span — to provide a comprehensive view of LCC studies applied to hydrogen technologies. We also discussed and interpreted the most significant findings. Results and discussion: Our main results can be summarised as follows: (i) the number of LCC studies for application to hydrogen technologies has increased in the decade 2012–2021; (ii) China is the leading country for number of publications on the subject (15 papers), even if the most prolific author and institution are Iranians; (iii) a large number of studies performed LCC analysis including fuel cells and/or electrolysers based on proton exchange membranes; (iv) the most widely used LCC approach is a cradle-to-consumer (37 papers); (vi) almost all the studies on LCC of hydrogen technologies included initial, operation and maintenance costs; while other costs — replacement, external, end-of-life — are included in a limited number of papers; (vii) the net present value (NPV) is the most used financial tool. Conclusions: LCC analysis for application to hydrogen technologies has gained interest in recent years. However, the number of studies that explicitly follow LCC or LCA guidelines is very limited (only 7). The life-cycle cost analyses performed are quite incomplete in terms of costs included in the life-cycle stages. Besides, there is a lack of information and uniformity in the use of functional units and financial tools. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of techno-economic modelling for hydrogen production from a photovoltaic battery electrolyser system (PBES) for injection into a natural gas transmission line. Mellitah in Libya, connected to Gela in Italy by the Greenstream subsea gas transmission line, is selected as the location for a case study. The PBES includes photovoltaic (PV) arrays, battery, electrolyser, hydrogen compressor, and large-scale hydrogen storage to maintain constant hydrogen volume fraction in the pipeline. Two PBES configurations with different large-scale storage methods are evaluated: PBESC with compressed hydrogen stored in buried pipes, and PBESL with liquefied hydrogen stored in spherical tanks. Simulated hourly PV electricity generation is used to calculate the specific hourly capacity factor of a hypothetical PV array in Mellitah. This capacity factor is then used with different PV sizes for sizing the PBES. The levelised cost of delivered hydrogen (LCOHD) is used as the key techno-economic parameter to optimise the size of the PBES by equipment sizing. The costs of all equipment, except the PV array and batteries, are made to be a function of electrolyser size. The equipment sizes are deemed optimal if PBES meets hydrogen demand at the minimum LCOHD. The techno-economic performance of the PBES is evaluated for four scenarios of fixed and constant hydrogen volume fraction targets in the pipeline: 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. The PBES can produce up to 106 kilotonnes of hydrogen per year to meet the 20% target at an LCOHD of 3.69 €/kg for compressed hydrogen storage (PBESC) and 2.81 €/kg for liquid hydrogen storage (PBESL). Storing liquid hydrogen at large-scale is significantly cheaper than gaseous hydrogen, even with the inclusion of a significantly larger PV array that is required to supply additional electrcitiy for liquefaction. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Natural gas is often considered a transition fuel to a deep decarbonized world. However, for this to happen, new technologies should be fostered, among which a natural gas-based H2 industry can become a key-option. This study tests the hypothesis that the development of a natural gas-based H2 industry equipped with CO2 capture can monetize natural gas remaining resources, mitigate CO2 emissions and facilitate the transition to the renewable energy-based H2. To do that, this study evaluates a stepwise strategy for setting up the development of H2, departing from the idle capacity in the existing natural gas industry, to progressively create a H2 independent supply. Findings indicated that this strategy can be feasible, according to the case study assessed at relatively moderate crude oil prices. Nevertheless, CO2 storage can become a constraint to deal with the co-produced CO2 from the steam methane reforming units. Therefore, it is worth developing storage options. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {As climate change makes it essential for the industry to move away from fossil fuels it is important to reconceptualize the entire system of energy production and distribution. In engineering design practice we focus on creating solutions and designs that may be highly effective and efficient without taking into account evolving market structures. We hypothesize that to realize evolving market structures, engineering design needs to be policy-driven and facilitate the monetization of investment by industry, and equitable social return on investment for the government and community. There is interest in transitioning to a low carbon hydrogen economy. There is a considerable body of work on making green hydrogen production cost-effective while also creating useful forms of carbon. There is little work done, however, on modeling the storage and distribution services for at-scale hydrogen deployment and cross-disciplinary modeling of technologies and services to enable an effective transition. In essence, current translation research is limited by an underlying assumption that the only obstacle to hydrogen adoption is achieving cost competitiveness, which disregards the roles that stakeholders (government, industry, and community) may play in enabling or hindering a transition. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying policies for transitioning to a low carbon hydrogen economy from a business (market structure) perspective. This involves framing a design problem for an evolving market from a policy-driven perspective. We use the business model canvas as the foundational framework to map the activities and services required to effectively supply resources and satisfy the demand to identify gaps in provided services and potential bottlenecks in transition or integration. We demonstrate this potential by using the business model canvas to identify a way forward in transitioning to a new market structure for a low carbon hydrogen economy. Copyright © 2022 by ASME.},

	abstract = {To determine if a power-to-gas pilot-scale plant would be possible in Oregon, a feasibility study was conducted that assessed the technical, political, economic, environmental, safety, and policy aspects of a potential project in the region. The results of this study were submitted as part of Oregon State University – Cascades' entry to the Hydrogen Education Foundation's 2018 student design competition. The Pacific Northwest has a need for long term energy storage (seasonal energy shifting) due to seasonally available low-priced, low-carbon electricity. There appears to be the political motivation and the technical feasibility to install a demonstration-scale power-to-gas plant in the region to assess the technical and economic performance of the system when exposed to real-world boundary conditions. However, preliminary economic analyses show the system will be challenged by low capacity factor operation resulting in a levelized cost of hydrogen of $121.81/kgH2 when only using otherwise curtailed electricity, or $8.84/kgH2 when running continuously for 6 months per annum. To fund a pilot scale plant a renewable gas development surcharge of $0.18/therm is proposed as a way for willing customers to support the decarbonization mission. There is precedent within the utility for such an incentive, indicating that it would be approved by the utility commission and could be a viable path forward for a pilot-scale plant. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {A linear analytical model has been developed for prediction of fluid-elastic instabilities of brine-strings during product retrieval in salt-mined caverns. These caverns are utilized for storage and subsequent retrieval of hydrocarbons, hydrogen gas or compressed air in Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) plants. The retrieval operation involves pumping brine downwards through a long cantilevered pipe (“brine-string”) into the cavern, causing the lighter-than-brine gaseous or liquid “product” stored in the cavern to flow upwards and out of the cavern through a shorter annular passage formed by a concentric casing surrounding the upper portion of the pipe. The presence in the cavern of two different fluids with a variable interface level is taken into account. Employing a Newtonian derivation of the equation of motion solutions were obtained via the Galerkin modal decomposition technique, demonstrating that the brine-string may develop buckling or flutter at high-enough flow rates, depending on the system parameters. Extensive computations investigated the influence of system parameters on the dynamics. It is shown that simplifying the system by considering a single fluid in the cavern, and so for the flows within and around the brine-string, leads to unrealistically high critical flow velocity predictions. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, a knowledge gap exists concerning the site-specific performance and economic viability of utilizing underground gas storage (UGS) sites for hydrogen storage in Europe. We compile information on European UGS sites to assess potential hydrogen storage capacity and evaluate the associated current and future costs. The total hydrogen storage potential in Europe is 349 TWh of working gas energy (WGE), with site-specific capital costs ranging from $10 million to $1 billion. Porous media and salt caverns, boasting a minimum storage capacity of 0.5 TWh WGE, exhibit levelized costs of $1.5 and $0.8 per kilogram of hydrogen, respectively. It is estimated that future levelized costs associated with hydrogen storage can potentially decrease to as low as $0.4 per kilogram after three experience cycles.

Hydrogen, as an energy vector, provides viable solutions for replacing polluting and carbon-emitting fossil fuels. Gaseous hydrogen can be stored underground and coupled with existing natural gas pipe networks. Salt cavern storage is the best suited technology to meet the challenges of new energy systems. Hydrogen storage caverns are currently operated in the UK and Texas. A preliminary risk analysis dedicated to underground hydrogen salt caverns highlighted the importance of containment losses (leaks) and the formation of gas clouds following blowouts, whose ignition may generate dangerous phenomena such as jet fires, unconfined vapor cloud explosions (UVCEs), or flashfires. A blowout is not a frequent accident in gas storage caverns. A safety valve is often set at a 30 m depth below ground level; it is automatically triggered following a pressure drop at the wellhead. Nevertheless, a blowout remains to be one of the significant accidental scenarios likely to occur during hydrogen underground storage in salt caverns. In this paper, we present modelling the subterraneous and aerial parts of a blowout on an EZ53 salt cavern fully filled with hydrogen. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The subsurface storage of hydrogen (H2) provides a potential solution for load-balancing of the intermittent electricity production from renewable energy sources. In such technical concept, surplus electricity is used to power electrolyzers that produce H2, which is then stored in subsurface formations to be used at times when renewable electricity is not available. Blending H2 with natural gas (NG) for injection into depleted gas/oil reservoirs, which are already used for NG storage, is considered a good option due to the lower initial capital cost and investment needed, and potential lower operating costs. In this study, the potential impact of storing a mixture of H2 and NG in an existing NG storage field was investigated. Relevant reservoir, caprock and cement samples from a NG storage formation in California were characterized with respect to their permeability, porosity, surface area, mineralogy and other structural characteristics, before and after undergoing 3-month incubation experiments with H2/NG gas mixtures at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. The results indicated relatively small changes in porosity and mineralogy due to incubation. However, the observed changes in permeability were more dramatic. In addition, polymeric materials, similar to those used in NG storage operations were also incubated, and their dimensions were measured before and after incubation. These measurements indicated swelling due to the exposure to H2. However, direct evidence of geochemical reactions involving H2 was not observed. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Electrical energy storage (EES) is necessary to enable greater penetration of renewables and as a grid-balancing solution, but current EES technologies suffer from capacity or geological limitations and high cost. Reversible solid oxide cells (ReSOCs) are an electrochemical energy conversion technology that can produce both electricity from fuel (gas-to-power) and fuel from electricity (power-to-gas), depending on resource availability and demand. Leveraging in situ C-O-H chemistry and operating at intermediate temperature (600°C) and elevated pressure (10–20 bar) enables these cells to be mildly exothermic, eliminating the need for external heat input or high over-potential (low-efficiency) operation during electrolysis mode. This operating strategy also results in higher methane production during electrolysis, facilitating easier integration with natural gas pipeline infrastructure over steam/hydrogen electrolytic processes. This study proposes a ReSOC system integrated with both natural gas pipeline and carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure to render a flexible, grid energy management resource. In gas-to-power mode, the system takes natural gas from a pipeline to produce electricity. Un-utilized fuel is combusted with oxygen and expanded through a turbine to produce more power. The water in the exhaust is condensed, and the remaining carbon dioxide is compressed for tanker or pipeline transportation to a carbon sequestration site. In power-to-gas mode, carbon dioxide and water are co-electrolyzed in the stack to produce methane and hydrogen, which can be injected directly into a natural gas pipeline or further refined into a purer stream of methane. We explore system design concepts, performance, and cost of a 50 MWe ReSOC system. Results indicate that synthetic natural gas (92.0% methane) can be produced at $22.7/MMBTU with a lower heating value efficiency of 81%. Alternatively, a system that net meters produced syngas and operates in power producing mode 50% of the time can generate electricity at a levelized cost of 10.5 ¢/kWh with an efficiency of 69% (LHV), while producing exhaust that is 95.5% carbon dioxide at 40 bar. If the system operates disproportionally in gas-to-power mode the LCOE drops to near 6 ¢/kWh. The economic outlook for mature ReSOC systems presented herein are found to be competitive with current energy storage technologies and natural gas peaker plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In that scenario, hydrogen is an eco-friendly fuel source with a calorific value of 120 MJ/kg which is significantly higher than fossil fuels. With a density of 0.09 kg/m3 at 273 K, hydrogen is just 1/14th that of air. Considering the enriched agricultural resources of Bangladesh, biomass gasification emerges as the most advantageous method for hydrogen production. Compared to other methods like steam reforming and electrolysis, biomass gasification offers significant cost advantages. Furthermore, being an overpopulated country generates significant organic waste annually. The mismanagement of these wastes creates problematic situations for both lives and surroundings. This review approaches the way of waste management and hydrogen production and additionally discusses the current scenario, several hydrogen production pathways, utilization, and storage.

As a result, decades of studies has led to a wide range of hydrides that can store hydrogen in a solid form. Applications of these solid-state hydrides are well-suited to stationary applications. However, the main challenge arises in making the selection of the Metal Hydrides (MH) that are best suited to meet application requirements. Herein, we discuss the current state-of-art in controlling the properties of room temperature (RT) hydrides suitable for stationary application and their long term behavior in addition to initial activation, their limitations and emerging trends to design better storage materials. The hydrogen storage properties and synthesis methods to alter the properties of these MH are discussed including the emerging approach of high-entropy alloys.

	abstract = {Storage safety, especially ensuring the gas sealability of hydrogen storage wells, needs to be carefully managed. Premium OCTG connections are used to connect casing and tubing pipes in these wells. Vallourec Research and Development department has investigated a new qualification testing protocol for hydrogen storage to properly validate connections for such application. The existing qualification standard for gas well was designed for the oil and gas industry and does not consider the specificities of hydrogen storage. The lifecycle of hydrogen storage is also expected to be different from standard gas underground storage. The approach is based on two main steps. In theory, hydrogen presents a higher capacity to leak through seals compared to methane or helium. In the first step, several gases are investigated to assess the sealability capacity of a connection with a metal-to-metal seal. Leaks detections devices by vacuum and accumulation with spectrometry were compared and assessed during this phase. For the second step, a dedicated connection test flow-chart is elaborated to consider the specific lifecycle of the hydrogen storage. The first test program involves several gas mixtures including different concentrations of hydrogen. The purpose of these tests is to determine which kind of gas mixture could be used for the future connection tests to assess 100% hydrogen gas content with the lowest representative hydrogen content to facilitate testing. It was demonstrated that the accumulation leak detection method allowed a better sensibility for the leak detection up to 10-7 mbar.L/s. The conclusion of this first phase is that up to 470 bars the metalto-metal seal behavior is the same for the different hydrogen concentration studied. In the second phase, storage lifecycle was studied. A connection test protocol was created to reflect the storage with a seasonal cycle and a daily cycle of loading and unloading when the storage well helps to cope with intermittencies of hydrogen production from renewables. This second test program was performed in full-scale in 9-5/8"47.00 ppf L80 on our latest generation of advanced premium T&C connections to assess the hydrogen sealability performance with positive results. These two test programs have demonstrated a significant improvement in the performance assessment of connections with metal-to-metal seal in these hydrogen storage wells. Large scale underground storage of hydrogen will be instrumental in global decarbonization. As hydrogen is a flammable, greenhouse gas, and more prone to leak, all the well completion and production equipment will need a specific validation. The current accepted standard used to assess connection performance is API RP 5C5, which is not fully relevant for hydrogen storage applications.  Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

We cover both experimental and computational studies, identify opportunities for performance enhancement, pathways for collector innovation, and implications of their wider deployment at the solar-generation system level. First, we classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air–water, heat-pipe, building integrated and concentrated PV-T collectors. This is followed by a presentation of performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we address wider PV-T systems and their applications, comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S–CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S–CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying and solar for hydrogen production systems. This includes a specific review of potential performance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar-generation system level in thermal energy storage, control and demand-side management. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed to analyse their carbon mitigation potential and how this technology might fit within pathways for global decarbonization. It is estimated that the REmap baseline emission curve can be reduced by more than 16% in 2030 if the uptake of solar PV-T technologies can be promoted. Finally, the review turns to a critical examination of key challenges for the adoption of PV-T technology and recommendations. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The environmental impact of CO2 emissions is widely acknowledged, making the development of alternative propulsion systems a priority. Hydrogen is a potential candidate to replace fossil fuels for transport applications, with three technologies considered for the onboard storage of hydrogen: storage in the form of a compressed gas, storage as a cryogenic liquid, and storage as a solid. These technologies are now competing to meet the requirements of vehicle manufacturers; each has its own unique challenges that must be understood to direct future research and development efforts. This paper reviews technological developments for Hydrogen Storage Vessel (HSV) designs, including their technical performance, manufacturing costs, safety, and environmental impact. More specifically, an up-to-date review of fiber-reinforced polymer composite HSVs was explored, including the end-of-life recycling options. A review of current numerical models for HSVs was conducted, including the use of artificial intelligence techniques to assess the performance of composite HSVs, leading to more sophisticated designs for achieving a more sustainable future. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As hydrogen production technologies continue to advance, efficient and high-capacity hydrogen storage solutions become increasingly crucial. To address the complex optimization challenges in the design of large-scale hydrogen storage pipeline networks, the study introduces a mixed integer nonlinear optimization model inspired by hydrogen pipeline design optimization theory. The model not only focuses on optimizing network design parameters but also aims to minimize investment costs. To achieve this, the study proposes an innovative hybrid genetic algorithm that combines the Modified Feasible Directions Method (MFDM) and Genetic Algorithm Theory (GAT), specifically targeting the optimization of pipeline diameter's discrete distribution challenges. Comparative analyses with SUMT and GA algorithms demonstrate the superiority of the approach. In continuous space, the algorithm achieves a lower convergence cost of 232.4437 × 104 Yuan, while in discrete space, the cost further decreases to 212.1636 × 104 Yuan. Additionally, the study delves into the sensitivity of the HGA-MFDM algorithm to ambient temperature and wellhead temperature in hydrogen storage facilities. The analysis reveals that wellhead temperature has a more significant impact on pipeline network investment, whereas ambient temperature exhibits a more pronounced effect on iteration curves. The findings provide valuable insights for the precise adjustment and optimization of hydrogen storage pipeline networks in practical applications. © 2024},

The core objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art and the future prospects of green hydrogen in the European energy system from economic, energetic and CO2 emissions point-of-view. The analysis shows that there are some increasing opportunities for hydrogen use in industry and in the transport sector, when electrification is not possible or is too expensive, as well as a storage in the European electricity system. However, a hydrogen-based energy system will remain a vision at least over the next decades. The major reason for this is the unfavorable economics mostly due to high investment costs in the whole supply chain. In addition, the overall efficiencies in the hydrogen chains are moderate in general. The full environmental benignity of hydrogen as an energy carrier is only provided when renewable energy sources are used for hydrogen production. However, in Europe, the potentials for green hydrogen are very limited due to the insufficient expansion of renewable electricity generation. For this reason, many European countries are considering options for green hydrogen import. The future of hydrogen is highly dependent on the supporting policy framework. To reduce the risk in the investment in hydrogen infrastructure, as well as to justify the promotion of green hydrogen, it is very important that Europe works out a very clear and realistic long-term implementation strategy. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The burst strength of tube and casing is important to the storage and development of hydrogen gas and natural gas. Studies on the current classic models to calculate burst pressure of tube and casing show that they are not suitable to predict the burst pressure of tube and casing under modern manufacturing technology level due to without considering the effects of radius-thickness ratio and practical service environment (capped-end condition and capped-open conditions). Hence, for the thin-wall (20＜D/t＜40) tube and casing, based on the deformation instability and finite strain theory, this paper has established the equations to calculate burst pressure of thin-wall pipe under capped-end condition and capped-open conditions by adopting the power-law constitutive relation. For the thick-wall (5 ≤ D/t ≤ 20) tube and casing, based on the failure criterion of through-wall yield, the unified algorithms of burst pressure for thick-wall pipe under capped-end condition and capped-open condition have been derived by adopting unified strength theory. The burst pressure model which can calculate the burst pressure of thick-wall pipe under modern manufacturing technology level, has been presented combining with weighting twin shear stress yield criterion. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the calculated results of this equation are closest to the test data, and its accuracy and reliability are obviously superior to other models, and the service environment of tube and casing has a great impact on the burst pressure. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

One of the most important areas of the energy transition is the development of hydrogen energy. This study aims to review and systematize the data available in the literature on the environmental and economic parameters of hydrogen storage and transportation technologies (both mature and at high technological readiness levels). The study concluded that salt caverns and pipeline transportation are the most promising methods of hydrogen storage and transportation today in terms of a combination of all parameters. These methods are the most competitive in terms of price, especially when transporting hydrogen over short distances. Thus, the average price of storage will be 0.35 USD/kg, and transportation at a distance of up to 100 km is 0.3 USD/kg. Hydrogen storage underground in a gaseous state and its transportation by pipelines have the least consequences for the environment: emissions and leaks are insignificant, and there is no environmental pollution. The study identifies these methods as particularly viable given their lower environmental impact and potential for seamless integration into existing energy systems, therefore supporting the transition to a more sustainable and circular economy. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In COP 26, the international community reaffirmed its ambitious targets to reduce carbon emission to mitigate climate change according to Paris Agreement. To achieve that target, a proper combination of energy efficiency and integration of renewables should be applied to ensure a smooth energy transition that balances the increasing demand and environmental commitments. Natural gas can work as a transition fuel between the polluting fossil fuels, and zero-emission renewables such as hydrogen. Carbon capture and sequestration is another important aspect that allows reducing already existing and future carbon emissions that arise from industrial processes. However, the storage and purification of natural gas, CO2 and H2 is still challenging and represents an overhead cost that slows down the energy transition process. This review discusses the use of “zeolitic ice” or clathrate hydrates as an environmentally benign material to help the energy transition process. Having structural topologies and properties that are identical to some zeolites and zeolitic clathrasils, those green materials showed unique properties that enable their utilization in different purposes related to the energy transition, such as gas separation, desalination, fuel cells, and others. The review especially focuses on their possible role to purify and safely store gases such as CH4, CO2, and H2, which are in the heart of energy transition. Amongst the objectives of the overview is to present different possible uses of clathrates, their benchmark against existing technologies, and the possibility to integrate them into current technologies with special focus on their application for energy storage and CCS. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production, storage, and transportation are the key issues to be addressed to realize a so-called clean and sustainable hydrogen economy. Various production methods, storage methods, and hydrogen transportations have been listed in the literature, along with their limitations. Therefore, to summarize the state of the art of these proposed technologies, a detailed discussion on hydrogen production, storage, and transportation is presented in this review. Also, to discuss the recent advancements of these methods including, hydrogen production, storage, and transportation on their kinetics, cyclic behavior, toxicity, pressure, thermal response, and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, new techniques such as ball milling, ultrasonic irradiation, ultrasonication, alloying, additives, cold rolling, alloying, and plasma metal reaction have been highlighted to address those drawbacks. Furthermore, the development of modern hydrogen infrastructure (reliability, safety, and low cost) is needed to scale up hydrogen delivery. This review summarizes promising techniques to enhance kinetic hydrogen production, storage, and transportation. Nevertheless, the search for the materials is still far from meeting the aimed target for production, storage, and transportation application. Therefore, more investigations are needed to identify promising areas for future H2 production, storage, and transportation developments. © 2022},

	abstract = {For more than twenty years, IFP Energies Nouvelles has been developing the thermodynamic library Carnot. While devoted to the origin of the oil and gas industry, Carnot is now focused on applications related to the new technologies of energy for an industry emphasizing decarbonization and sustainability, such as CCUS, biomass, geothermal, hydrogen, or plastic and metal recycling. Carnot contains several dozens of predictive and correlative thermodynamic models, including well-established and more recent equations of state and activity coefficient models, as well as many specific models to calculate phase properties. Carnot also contains a dozen flash algorithms making possible the computation of various types of phase equilibrium, including not only two-phase and three-phase fluid equilibria but also configurations with reactive systems and with solid phases such as hydrates, wax, asphaltene, or salts. The library Carnot has a double role: first, it is a standalone toolbox for thermodynamic research and development studies. Coupled with an optimization tool, it allows to develop new thermodynamic models and to propose specific parameterizations adapted to any context. Secondly, Carnot is used as the thermodynamic engine of commercial software, such as Carbonee, Convergee, TemisFlowe, CooresFlowe or Moldie. Through this software, several hundreds of end-users are nowadays performing their thermodynamic calculations with Carnot. It has also been directly applied to design industrial processes such as the DMXe process for CO2 capture, the ATOLâ and BioButterFlye solutions for bio-olefins production, and Futurole and BioTFuele for biofuels production. In this context, this article presents some significant realizations made with Carnot for both R&D and industrial applications, more specifically in the fields of CO2 capture and storage, flow assurance, chemistry, and geoscience. © The Author(s).},

However, the durability and suitability of commonly used steels for piping in hydrogen salt caverns is still under research. In this work, aging effects focusing on corrosion and cracking patterns of casing steel API 5CT J55 and “H2ready” pipeline steel API 5L X56 were investigated with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy after accelerated stress tests with pressure/temperature cycling under hydrogen salt cavern-like conditions. Compared to dry conditions, significant more corrosion by presence of salt ions was detected. However, compared to X56, only for J55 an intensification of corrosion and cracking at the surface due to hydrogen atmosphere was revealed. Pronounced surface cracks were observed for J55 over the entire samples. Overall, the results strongly suggest that X56 is more resistant than J55 under the conditions of a hydrogen salt cavern. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Climate change is the most pressing challenge faced today. Carbon emissions from industry, transport and other forms of energy continue to threaten the future. Industrialised countries are desperately considering running carbon-neutral goals by 2050. Among the strategies under consideration, integrating hydrogen into natural gas streams, known as hydrogen blending with natural gas, has achieved substantial attention from academia, industry, and governmental bodies. This article thoroughly explores the potential of decarbonisation by integrating hydrogen into natural gas networks. It aims to provide valuable insights by addressing challenges, opportunities, and crucial factors influencing hydrogen-natural gas (H2-NG) blends in gas distribution systems. The article covers safety considerations across hydrogen's entire lifecycle, including production, transportation, storage, and utilisation. It also delves into the complex issue of pipeline corrosion, highlighting its significance for structural integrity when dealing with H2-NG blends. Furthermore, the article significantly focuses on hydrogen embrittlement (HE), discussing classifications, mechanisms, consequences, and mitigation strategies within blended gas networks. It also explores developments in pipeline coatings, evaluating their compatibility and efficacy in mitigating HE and corrosion within H2-NG blends. Finally, the study employs bibliometric analysis to guide researchers by drawing insights from existing literature and identifying potential avenues for future progress in H2-NG blending. By addressing the multifaceted aspects of decarbonisation through H2-NG blending, this article aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable energy strategies. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) is being acknowledged as the future energy carrier due to its high energy density and potential to mitigate the intermittency of other renewable energy sources. H2 also ensures a clean, carbon-neutral, and sustainable environment for current and forthcoming generations by contributing to the global missions of decarbonization in the transportation, industrial, and building sectors. Several H2 storage technologies are available and have been employed for its secure and economical transport. The existing H2 storage and transportation technologies like liquid-state, cryogenic, or compressed hydrogen are in use but still suffer from significant challenges regarding successful realization at the commercial level. These factors affect the overall operational cost of technology. Therefore, H2 storage demands novel technologies that are safe for mobility, transportation, long-term storage, and yet it is cost-effective. This review article presents potential opportunities for H2 storage technologies, such as physical and chemical storage. The prime characteristics and requirements of H2 storage are briefly explained.

These challenges stem from hydrogen's different properties compared to natural gas, such as higher ignition probability, different flame behavior, and potential for hydrogen embrittlement. Although risk assessments for hydrogen pipelines are increasing, the impact of hydrogen on the risk of third-party excavation damage (TPD), the major cause of pipeline incidents in the U.S., has received little attention. This work presents the SHyTERP model for Safe Hydrogen Transportation and Excavation Risk Prevention for Pipelines. The model incorporates causal models, excavation damage and pipeline failure statistics, and validated physical models of hydrogen and natural gas release and jet flame behavior. Through four case studies, the model compares the TPD risks of hydrogen and natural gas pipelines, offering insights and recommendations for the safe implementation of hydrogen in existing pipelines. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {High-quality borehole is crucial to hydrogen underground storage (HUS) and oil & gas development, while compound drilling plays an important role in improving borehole quality. The modal model of compound drillstring in slim borehole is established by using finite element method to analyze the modal of longitudinal vibration, lateral vibration and torsional vibration. The results shows that as the number of order increases, the intrinsic frequency of the three vibrations increases. The amplitude of axial vibration is the largest, and the amplitude of lateral vibration is smallest. The natural frequency of drillstring in slim borehole decreases as drillstring length increasing. The longer drillstring is, the smaller the interval frequency between the intrinsic frequencies of orders will be, and it is easier to cause resonance. The axial vibration will cause minimal damage to the HUS quality. Lateral vibration has the greatest damage to wellbore quality, and is the most unfavorable for the establishment of HUS channels. The damage of torsional vibration to the HUS is less than the lateral vibration and larger than axial vibration. The higher the vibration frequency and amplitude, the harder it is to improve the HUS quality. In order to improve the quality of HUS, the weight on bit (WOB) and rotary per minutes (RPM) should be adjusted at the same time for lateral shock, and the WOB should be mainly reduced for controlling the axial and torsional vibration. The results are benefit for the drillstring design, improving the wellbore quality and HUS quality. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen energy storage (UHES) in lined rock caverns (LRCs) is a promising solution for mitigating the instability of clean energy generation. However, the hydrogen injection/extraction process may activate potential faults surrounding the caverns, jeopardizing the service safety of the lining structures. In this study, a novel polymeric sealing layer was developed and tested for UHES, to replace the traditional steel lining. A numerical model of fault activation was established to analyze the mechanical response of the lining structures under various parameters, such as injection/extraction operation parameters, fault characteristics, and concrete lining forms. Results show that the stress level of the concrete lining is directly related to the number of hydrogen injection/extraction cycles, fault angle, and magnitude, while it diminishes with increasing fault distance. The flexible joint fillers could disperse the circumferential stress and absorb energy continuously during fault activation, resulting in lower stress levels and damage to segmental concrete lining, compared with integral concrete lining. The sealing layer, protected by the concrete lining, experiences lower stress fluctuations during fault activation. Additionally, the results obtained show that a certain distance threshold for fault-induced damage to the concrete lining was identified, beyond which fault activation no longer triggers damage. The distance threshold was tentatively determined to be 20 m. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is regarded as one of the most important energy sources for the future. Safe, large-scale storage of hydrogen contributes to the commercial development of the hydrogen industry. Use of bedded salt caverns for natural gas storage in China provides a new option for underground hydrogen storage (UHS). In this study, the physical properties of multicomponent gases in UHS and salt rock are reviewed and discussed, along with the flow of hydrogen in the surrounding salt rock. Mathematical models of the two-phase multicomponent flow of the gas–brine system in the UHS were established. A numerical model of a simplified elliptical salt cavern was built to simulate the migration of the gas–brine system in the UHS. The hydrogen tightness of the UHS was evaluated through simulation with different storage strategies, salt rock and interlayer permeabilities, and gas components. The results indicate that: (1) Cyclic injection and withdrawal facilitate hydrogen leakage, which is accelerated by increasing the frequency. (2) The huff-n-puff of hydrogen gas in the injection and withdrawal cycles forces the gas into pore space and enhances the relative permeability of the gas phase. The migration of hydrogen and brine weakens the hydrogen tightness. Brine saturation is an important index for evaluating the hydrogen tightness of UHS. (3) The leakage rate of UHS increases with an increase in the permeability of the salt rock and interlayer and the total thickness of the interlayers. The average permeability Kwa weighted by the thickness of layers for the bedded salt formation is proposed to integrate three variables to facilitate field application of the simulation results. The critical Kwa is less than 3.02 × 10−17 m2 if the recommended annual hydrogen leakage rate is less than 1%. (4) The difference between hydrogen and other gas species is another important factor in the leakage rate and should be considered. This study provides theoretical guidance for evaluating the feasibility of UHS in salt caverns and site selection in China. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The configuration of heat exchanger structure design plays a crucial role in improving heat and mass transfer effect in metal hydride beds.

In this work, the development of metal hydride bed design in recent decades has been reviewed to help the readers summarize and optimize the reactor configuration. The summarization and review of metal hydrides design can be broadly classified into five distinct categories, which are: 1) design of cooling tubes, 2) design of fins, 3) increasing and arrangement of cooling tubes, 4) other geometric design, and 5) utilization of phase change material. This work is concentrated on assessing the heat and mass transfer effectiveness of various reactor structure configurations. The superiority and weakness of different configurations are summarized to give a comparison of the heat exchange effects. Moreover, the structural parameter analysis for each configuration is also reviewed from the heat and mass transfer aspect.

	abstract = {A green hydrogen (H2) economy requires a sustainable, efficient, safe, and widespread infrastructure for transporting and distributing H2 from production to consumption sites. Transporting a hydrogen/natural gas (H2NG) mixture, including pure H2, through the existing European natural gas (NG) infrastructure is considered a cost-effective solution, particularly in the transitional phase. Several reasons justify the H2NG blending option. The NG infrastructure can be efficiently repurposed to transport H2, by blending H2 with NG, to operate as H2 daily storage, matching production and demand and to enable large-scale seasonal H2 storage. Although many benefits exist, the potential of existing NG grids for transporting and distributing green H2 may face limitations due to technical, economic, or normative concerns. This paper focuses on the state of the art of the European NG transmission and distribution metrology normative framework and identifies the gaps to be filled in case of H2NG flowing into the existing grids.

	abstract = {Concentrating solar power systems are crucial for capturing solar energy. However, the intermittent nature of sunlight necessitates effective energy storage solutions. Ammonia-based thermochemical energy storage systems have emerged as a promising option, utilizing solar energy to dissociate ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen gas. This gaseous mixture is then employed for exothermic ammonia synthesis, releasing energy for a continuous thermal power cycle. This study focuses on the optimal design of a novel ammonia synthesis process, which uses absorption for ammonia separation instead of condensation, for solar thermochemical energy recovery. A comprehensive first-principles model of the system, encompassing ammonia synthesis and absorption, heat exchange, and gas compression and storage, was developed. An optimization problem was formulated considering standard materials and design constraints, and a nested optimization/simulation approach was employed to integrate the transient absorption behavior with steady-state design. The results provide optimal dimensions and operating conditions for all process units, minimizing the total capital cost. Various operating pressures were examined, revealing minimal differences among the optimal results. The proposed absorbent-enhanced ammonia synthesis process can heat supercritical steam from 350 to 720 °C, producing approximately 40.6 MWt with discharging and exergetic efficiencies of around 85 and 25%, respectively. Given that the storage tank is the most expensive unit, it was replaced with underground storage, resulting in a levelized cost of heat of about 1.6 ¢/kWht.

	abstract = {Hydrogen storage systems (HSSs), are the backbone of feasible hydrogen economy. To provide a reliable renewable energy system, safe, cost effective and compact HSS is due. Physical storage systems involve the compressed gas, liquid and cryo-compressed techniques while material based one involves adsorptive materials, metal hydrides and chemical storage materials. In this paper, the features of a variety of HSSs are impartially discussed. The technical comparative analysis of the different physical and material based types of HSSs illustrates the paradoxical inherent features, including gravimetric and volumetric storage densities and parameters associated with storage and release processes, among these systems. Accordingly, no ideal hydrogen storage technique can be considered the best-fit for all stationary and automotive applications. Therefore, not only a unique HSS solution can properly provide the needs, but a set of complementary HSS solutions which may offer the system designer several options. This set of options can be hardly interpretable in case of the unclear definition of the application needs which may be time variant. Inside this review, the critical insights and recommendations about suitable applications for storage systems are provided. Different standards and codes alongside the corresponding tests are demonstrated for the different storage technologies. Moreover, storage vessels research work is overviewed for the different hydrogen storage technologies. In addition, the failure behaviour, criteria and prediction models are investigated for composite vessels subjected to high pressures and extreme temperatures degrading their mechanical behaviour and failure resistance. © 2021},

	abstract = {To evaluate the possibility of hydrogen storage in depleted gas reservoirs, natural gas storage facilities, aquifers and salt caverns, the applicability of ferritic pearlitic K55 and tempered martensitic L80, both very frequently used as casings and tubings, has been investigated. Materials were investigated by means of high-pressure, high-temperature autoclave tests and analyses of the hydrogen uptake. The autoclave tests were performed on tensile specimens loaded with a spring at 90 % of the specified minimum yield strength, additionally the samples were analysed to determine the hydrogen uptake. Different gas compositions were considered (pure hydrogen, with or without the presence of CO2/H2S) under a hydrogen partial pressure of 120 bar. The tests were conducted in dry or wet environments. From the results, it can be seen that the hydrogen uptake is low even under the most severe conditions. However, from the mechanical test conducted in this study, it appears that the ferritic pearlitic K55 steel seems to be a suitable pipe material for underground hydrogen storage, and the higher strength steel L80 steel can be used only in non-sour environments (no significant amount of H2S in the reservoir, which is a priori the case of underground storages). © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Metal hydride (MH) hydrogen storage systems have gained interest as an efficient and safe method for hydrogen storage. An extremely high chemical reaction rate and rapid heat transfer should be the characteristics of an ideal metal hydride reactor (MHR). However, the thermal conductivity of a metal hydride bed (MHB) is only 0.1-1.5 W m−1 K−1, which poses a challenge in practical applications and makes it urgent to adopt an efficient thermal management approach. This paper reviews the development of the MHB thermal management over the past few decades, which can be divided into three parts: (1) from the MHR structure, methods like adding cooling tubes and fins are adopted to enhance the heat transfer between the MHR and the outside environment; (2) from the material perspective, thermal conductivity enhancers that include metal foams and expanded natural graphite (ENG) are introduced to the MHB to improve the effective thermal conductivity of the MHB; and (3) a phase change material (PCM) is employed to strengthen the heat transformation inside the MHB and reduce the energy loss. This research is focused on evaluating the impact of various thermal management measures on heat and mass transfer and comparing their heat transfer effectiveness, summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of different MHR structures. Finally, some views on the future designs of MHBs are proposed. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The LCORE methodology accounts for capital costs, financing costs, operation and maintenance costs, energy efficiency of each step, technology lifetime, and replacement costs. Results show that the most valuable use of the renewable hydrogen is as fuel for fuel cell electric vehicles, although the costs of the hydrogen fueling infrastructure are estimated to be high using the existing paradigm of trucking, compression, and dispensing (adding more than $7/kilogram to the price of hydrogen). Importantly, the analyses show that the range of costs for pathways that produce hydrogen by electrolysis from renewable generation and return it to the electric grid using the natural gas system to transport the hydrogen to an existing combined cycle plant to produce the electricity have costs of $76-$210/MWh. These costs are directly competitive with battery energy storage pathways at $51-$150/MWh while also providing energy storage over durations as long as months, durations that are that are not technically feasible for many battery technologies due to charge leakage. © 2020 ECS-The Electrochemical Society.},

	abstract = {The energy sector is nowadays facing new challenges, mainly in the form of a massive shifting towards renewable energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels and a diffusion of the distributed generation paradigm, which involves the application of small-scale energy generation systems. In this scenario, systems adopting one or more renewable energy sources and capable of producing several forms of energy along with some useful substances, such as fresh water and hydrogen, are a particularly interesting solution. A hybrid polygeneration system based on renewable energy sources can overcome operation problems regarding energy systems where only one energy source is used (solar, wind, biomass) and allows one to use an all-in-one integrated systems in order to match the different loads of a utility. From the point of view of scientific literature, medium- and large-scale systems are the most investigated; nevertheless, more and more attention has also started to be given to small-scale layouts and applications. The growing diffusion of distributed generation applications along with the interest in multipurpose energy systems based on renewables and capable of matching different energy demands create the necessity of developing an overview on the topic of small-scale hybrid and polygeneration systems. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the technology, operation, performance, and economical aspects of hybrid and polygeneration renewable energy systems in small-scale applications. In particular, the review presents the technologies used for energy generation from renewables and the ones that may be adopted for energy storage. A significant focus is also given to the adoption of renewable energy sources in hybrid and polygeneration systems, designs/modeling approaches and tools, and main methodologies of assessment. The review shows that investigations on the proposed topic have significant potential for expansion from the point of view of system configuration, hybridization, and applications. © 2022 by the authors.},

Two mathematical models, namely, the species transport model and the multiphase mixture model, are commonly used to describe the stratification phenomena of HENG. To evaluate the suitability of both models in simulating the stratification phenomena of HENG, the model accuracy was initially validated by comparing with published experimental data. Subsequently, the spontaneous concentration distribution trend in a binary gas mixture (hydrogen + methane) system within an enclosed space is analyzed based on the principles of minimum energy. The findings indicate that the species transport model is more suitable for describing the distribution of HENG in enclosed spaces; the HENG mixture gradually attains uniform concentration distribution when it remains static and eventually reaches equilibrium without any obvious concentration stratification. This study aims at offering valuable insights for ensuring safe transportation and storage of HENG. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

This article is an overview of the overall supply chain, including production, transport, storage and end uses. Available fuel conversion technologies use renewable energy for the catalytic conversion of non-fossil feedstocks into hydrogen and syngas. We will show how relevant technologies involve thermochemical, electrochemical and photochemical processes. The syngas quality can be improved by catalytic CO and CO2 methanation reactions for the generation of synthetic natural gas. Finally, the produced gaseous fuels could follow several pathways for transport and lead to different final uses. Therefore, storage alternatives and gas interchangeability requirements for the safe injection of green fuels in the natural gas network and fuel cells are outlined.

	abstract = {Greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), have the effect of raising the Earth's temperature. To combat this issue and reduce carbon emissions, it is advisable to shift towards the widespread utilization of cleaner fuels, such as hydrogen. The establishment of a global-scale hydrogen economy, coupled with hydrogen geological storage, presents a viable solution to meet the world's energy demands while accommodating peak usage periods. In geological hydrogen (H2) storage, the rock formation wetting characteristics are essential to regulate fluid dynamics, injection rates, the spread of gas within the rock matrix, and safety considerations. The wetting characteristics of minerals within the rock are significantly influenced by geological factors. To assess the wetting behavior of a mineral/H2/brine system under geo-storage conditions, innovative approaches have emerged. This research utilized a combination of advanced machine learning models, such as fully connected neural networks, adaptive gradient boosting, random forests, decision trees, and extreme gradient boosting to forecast the wettability characteristics of a ternary system comprising hydrogen (H2), brine, and specific rock minerals (namely quartz and mica). The predictions were made under various conditions, including different pressures ranging from 0 to 25 MPa, temperatures spanning from 308 to 343 K, and salinities of 10 wt.% NaCl solution. The machine learning models demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting mineral/H2/brine system's wettability (contact angles, advancing and receding). Incorporation of various experimental values have established correlations based on ML techniques. The performance and reliability of these models were rigorously assessed using statistical methods and graphical analyses. The deployed ML models consistently provided accurate predictions of wettability across diverse operational scenarios. Notably, the suggested model exhibited a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.214 during training and 0.810 during testing. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis revealed that pressure exerted the most significant influence on mineral/H2/brine system's wettability. These ML model outcomes can be effectively utilized to anticipate hydrogen geological storage capacities and ensure the security of restraint in large-scale developments.

The influence of regulatory requirements on P and A practices and the impact of selected barrier material on possible repurposing of depleted reservoirs for hydrogen and CO2 storage are also discussed. This review reveals that previous studies in these areas have focused primarily on improving plug placement and durability without significant consideration of the potential for long term development of leakage paths in the old wellbore infrastructure (cement and casing) whose surfaces remain exposed to reservoir fluids below the permanent plug after conventional P and A. The need for a new approach to plug and abandonment materials selection and reengineering of materials placement methods to ensure permanent isolation of reservoir fluids from existing well infrastructure is herein identified especially as the stock of wells nearing their end of life grows on a global scale. A summary of studies in the accelerated degradation of Portland cement in the presence of corrosive reservoir fluid under high temperature and pressure conditions is also presented. This will significantly drive research in materials selection for alternative barrier as HPHT wells mature for permanent abandonment. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Thermal energy storage (TES) plays an important role in improving efficiency of both conventional and renewable energy systems. The phase change material (PCM) based latent heat TES (LHTES) shows great potential due to the large heat storage density and nearly isothermal feature. The phase change slurry (PCS) is a mixture of solid PCM particles and liquid carrying fluid, which can be adopted as both the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and energy storage medium. The 1-component slurry such as slush hydrogen, slush nitrogen and ice slurry, as well as clathrate hydrate slurry (CHS) are shellless PCSs, in which the mass transfer between the solid PCM particles and liquid carrying fluid occurs during phase change process. The present two-part review surveys the investigations of such shellless PCSs in recent years. This paper is the first part of the review, which makes a brief introduction of the preparation methods and properties of each type of the PCS and a comprehensive summary of the applications of these PCSs in different fields.

	abstract = {Fossil fuels continue to exacerbate climate change due to large carbon emissions resulting from their use across a number of sectors. An energy transition away from fossil fuels seems inevitable, and energy sources such as renewables and hydrogen may provide a low carbon alternative for the future energy system, particularly in large emitting nations such as the United States. This research quantifies and maps potential hydrogen fuel distribution pathways for the continental US, reflecting technological changes, barriers to deployment, and end-use-cases from 2020 to 2100, clarifying the potential role of hydrogen in the US energy transition. The methodology consists of two parts, a linear optimization of the global energy system constrained by carbon reduction targets and system cost, followed by a projection of hydrogen infrastructure development. Key findings include the emergence of trade pattern diversification, with a greater variety of end-uses associated with imported fuels and greater annual hydrogen consumption over time. Further, sensitivity analysis identified the influence of complementary technologies including nuclear power and carbon capture and storage technologies. We conclude that hydrogen penetration into the US energy system is economically viable and can contribute toward achieving Paris Agreement and more aggressive carbon reduction targets in the future. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {It is now well established that electrochemical systems can optimally perform only within a narrow range of temperature. Exposure to temperatures outside this range adversely affects the performance and lifetime of these systems. As a result, thermal management is an essential consideration during the design and operation of electrochemical equipment and, can heavily influence the success of electrochemical energy technologies. Recently, significant attempts have been placed on the maturity of cooling technologies for electrochemical devices. Nonetheless, the existing reviews on the subject have been primarily focused on battery cooling. Conversely, heat transfer in other electrochemical systems commonly used for energy conversion and storage has not been subjected to critical reviews. To address this issue, the current study gives an overview of the progress and challenges on the thermal management of different electrochemical energy devices including fuel cells, electrolysers and supercapacitors. The physicochemical mechanisms of heat generation in these electrochemical devices are discussed in-depth. Physics of the heat transfer techniques, currently employed for temperature control, are then exposed and some directions for future studies are provided. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {To reduce carbon emissions, generation of electricity from combustion systems is being replaced by renewable resources. However, the most abundant renewable sources – solar and wind – are not dispatchable, vary diurnally and are subject to intermittency, and produce electricity at times in excess of demand (excess production). To manage this variability and capture the excess renewable energy, energy storage technologies are being developed and deployed such as battery energy storage (BES), hydrogen production with electrolyzers (ELY) paired with hydrogen energy storage (HES) and fuel cells (FCs), and renewable natural gas (RNG) production. While BES may be better suited for short duration storage, hydrogen is suited for long duration storage and RNG can decarbonize the natural gas system. California Senate Bill 100 (SB100) sets a goal that all retail electricity sold in the State must be sourced from renewable and zero-carbon resources by 2045, raising the questions of which set of technologies and in what proportion are required to meet the 2045 target in the required timeframe as well as the role of the natural gas infrastructure, if any. To address these questions, this study combines electric grid dispatch modeling and optimization to identify the energy storage and dispatchable technologies in 5-year increments from 2030 to 2045 required to transition from a 60% renewable electric grid in 2035 to a 100% renewable electric grid in 2045. The results show that, by utilizing the established natural gas system to store and transmit hydrogen and RNG, the deployment of battery energy storage is dramatically reduced. The required capacity for BES in 2045, for example, is 40 times lower by leveraging the natural gas infrastructure with a concomitant reduction in cost and associated challenges to transform the electric grid. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Sand production, a challenge in the geo-energy industry, compromises reservoir integrity and equipment by eroding and transporting sand grains from unconsolidated and weakly consolidated reservoirs, which is crucial in oil, gas, geothermal, and underground hydrogen storage systems. Effective management and accurate prediction of sand behaviors are essential for maintaining wellbore stability and optimizing energy extraction processes. This study comprehensively reviews the discrete element method (DEM) used over the past three decades for simulating sand production, a significant phenomenon causing substantial equipment damage and financial losses in the geo-energy industry. Our review elaborates on the adaptation of DEM for modeling the mechanical behavior of sandstone, sandy materials, and granular packs, which is essential for predicting and mitigating sand production. We categorize the review into five key areas—force models, bond models, damping models, particle shape, and particle size distribution. These aspects are pivotal in enhancing the realism of DEM simulations. The review critically assesses current methodologies and their limitations, emphasizing the need for precise parameter selection in DEM to yield realistic simulations, aligning with the emerging trends and technological advancements in geotechnical engineering. © 2023},

	abstract = {Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) is an emerging technology which aims to store terawatt-scale energy in the subsurface to alleviate daily and seasonal fluctuations in the ever-increasing renewable energy market. Depleted gas reservoirs and aquifers will be the main targets of storage which requires an understanding of the interaction between formation or cushion gas with native brine. A comprehensive comparison of the petrophysical and two-phase flow properties of the hydrogen-water, methane-water and nitrogen-water systems at in-situ conditions is the focus of our work. We conduct steady-state relative permeability experiments at 2.13 MPa and 298 K using identical capillary numbers of Nc=2.92×10−7 for all three systems. The saturation and in-situ contact angles are determined with segmentation of 3D micro-CT images. The contact angle of each system is almost identical at the irreducible water saturation, Swi, 44°, 46°, 45°, respectively, as is the interfacial tension of 72.0, 71.5 and 71mN/m, respectively. The capillary pressure-saturation relationships for each system have a maximum difference of 3.8 % which leads to approximately equivalent relative permeability in the Bentheimer sandstone core. The end-point relative permeabilities are krg 0=0.049, krg 0=0.045 and krg 0=0.062 at irreducible water saturations of Swi=0.24, Swi=0.25 and Swi=0.23, respectively. All three gases demonstrate equivalent flow properties which indicates that both nitrogen and methane are suitable analogue gases for laboratory multiphase flow experiments and cushion gas to improve safety and the economics of commercial UHS projects. The results enable history matched depleted gas reservoir performance to be used as a guide for UHS. © 2023},

	abstract = {Underground Hydrogen Storage in Reservoirs (UHSR) is promising for long-term and large-scale renewable energy storage, yet improvements in capacity and efficiency are still highly demanded, which requires a deep understanding of the pore-scale mechanisms. Here, we investigate UHSR using micromodels and discover three pore-scale mechanisms, namely the preferential-to-uniform flow transformation, floating flow, and dead-end pore invasion. Preferential flows ensure the base storage capacity and the early transformation to uniform flows promotes the storage efficiency. Floating flow not only enhances the flow transformation but also increases the storage capacity via its facilitation for dead-end pore invasion. We also provide pore-scale mechanism-based elucidation for the effects of pore heterogeneity, injection flux, and oil/brine distribution on storage capacity and efficiency. Injection flux affects the preferential and floating flows to regulate the rate of base storage and determine whether controlling the flow profile or breaking through the outlet via inertia induced preferential flow. Pore heterogeneity affects the proportion of dynamic dead-end pores and possibility of breaking through via capillary induced preferential flow. In comparison with brine saturated condition, the oil saturated condition is unfavorable of floating flow and dead-end invasion. We propose that brine saturated initial condition with high injection flux and median pore heterogeneity are optimal for both UHSR capacity and efficiency from our micromodel study. We further optimize the capacity from 50 % to 95 % and the efficiency from 7.4 × 10-2 kg/(m3·s) to 2.1 × 10-1 kg/(m3·s) according to revealed mechanisms and influencing factors. From the microscale perspective, this work brings critical insights for enhancing and broadening the application of UHSR engineering practice. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage represents an innovative approach to energy storage. To ensure the secure operation of subterranean hydrogen storage strings, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology was employed to devise an erosion assessment model tailored for high-velocity conditions. The research delved into the erosion and abrasion dynamics of these storage strings when subjected to high-speed gas flows. This study further examined the impacts of gas velocity, particle size, pipe material, and pipe wall corrosion imperfections on flow patterns and erosion wear rates across the column. The outcomes revealed several noteworthy trends. As fluid velocity increased, the flow field’s maximum pressure augmented, while it decreased alongside enlarging pipe diameter and particle size. P110 pipe material exhibited higher maximum pressure in comparison to N80. The effect of centrifugal force induced pressure to surge from the inner to the outer portion of the column. In the curved pipe section’s outer wall, the frequent occurrence of high-angle collisions engendered elevated rates of erosion wear over time. Particularly noteworthy was the observation of the highest erosion rate in curved pipes showcasing three corrosion defects, attributed to the backflow effects of erosion pits. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In light of advancing climate change, environmentally-friendly methods for generating renewable energy are being employed to an increasing extent. This use, however, leads to rising spatial and temporal disbalances between electricity generation and consumption. To address the associated challenges, Power-to-X technologies are considered to harness surplus electricity from renewable sources and convert it into an alternative energy source that can be utilized, transported and stored. The aim of this paper is to compare four different Power-to-X technologies, whereby surplus electricity “Power” is converted to chemical entities “X”. It is shown that the implementation of PtX technologies and a shift of energy distribution to other transport methods could significantly relieve the electricity grid. Moreover, by converting the electricity from renewable sources, like wind farms, into chemical energy sources, the PtX concept offers the opportunity of making larger quantities of energy storable over longer periods of time. By considering a model case where electricity generation and consumption are several hundred kilometres apart, the generation of fuels emerges as a technology with the highest potential to mitigate climate change. Also with regard to transport, fuels emerge as the most favourable option for transporting chemically bound energy. Common to all options is the yield of a significant stream of oxygen as by-product. Utilizing this oxygen may be one of the key factors towards improving the economic viability of Power-to-X technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Power-to-gas is a key area of interest for decarbonisation and increasing flexibility in energy systems, as it has the potential both to absorb renewable electricity at times of excess supply and to provide backup energy at times of excess demand. By integrating power-to-gas with the natural gas grid, it is possible to exploit the inherent linepack flexibility of the grid, and shift some electricity variability onto the gas grid. Furthermore, provided the gas injected into the gas grid is low-carbon, such as hydrogen from renewable power-to-gas, then overall greenhouse gas emissions from the gas grid can be reduced. This work presents the first review of power-to-gas to consider real-life projects, economic assessments and systems modelling studies, and to compare them based on scope, assumptions and outcomes. The review focuses on power-to-gas for injection into the gas grid, as this application has specific economic, technical and modelling opportunities and challenges. The review identified significant interest in, and potential for, power-to-gas in combination with the gas grid, however there are still challenges to overcome to find profitable business cases and manage local and system-wide technical issues. Whilst significant modelling of power-to-gas has been undertaken, more is needed to fully understand the impacts of power-to-gas and gas grid injection on the operational behaviour of the gas grid, taking into account dynamic and spatial effects. © 2018 The Author(s)},

Moreover, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) systems can also be used to dispatch the hydrogen back to the grid as power.

A coupled, pore-scale model is presented which aids in the investigation of the mechanisms that govern the conversion of hydrogen to methane, i.e. advective hydrogen flow, its diffusion into microbial biofilms of multiple species, and its consumption within these biofilms. The model assumes that spherical grains are coated by a film of residual water and treats the biofilm development within each film in a quasi one-dimensional manner.

	abstract = {Hydrogen technologies can play an important role in decarbonising our energy system in a variety of ways across the energy value chain. It is therefore critical to identify the strategic roles as well as the conditions under which hydrogen energy systems become attractive for the energy transition. In this paper, the authors present a techno-economic review of hydrogen energy systems including power-to-power, power-to-gas, hydrogen refuelling and stationary fuel cells. We focus on their optimal operation as flexible assets and we identify three actions that can foster their uptake beyond technological progress. First, we recommend optimal electricity supply with dedicated control strategies considering that electricity dominates the levelised cost of hydrogen production via electrolysis. Secondly, hydrogen can enable the further integration of traditionally independent sectors, namely electricity, heat and transport while contributing to decarbonise all. This position can also be advantageous for investors who sell heat and fuels as energy efficient products. Lastly, we examine a whole range of revenues from different products and applications which can be combined (i.e. benefit stacking) to match capital and operational expenditures. We discuss these roles in depth and we conclude that policy makers together with technology developers should elaborate smart strategies to reduce cost by scaling production, stimulate standardisation (e.g., similar to the PV industry) as well as develop new market structures and regulatory frameworks which allow hydrogen technologies to deliver multiple low carbon applications and products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has been highlighted as a potential method to enable the continued use of fossil-fuelled power stations through the abatement of carbon dioxide (CO2). A complete CCS cycle requires safe, reliable and cost effective solutions for the transmission of CO2 from the capturing facility to the location of permanent storage. This publication presents a detailed review of the integrity risks posed to dense-phase CO2 pipelines in the form of internal corrosion. To begin, the current worldwide experience in handling dense-phase CO2 and the anthropogenic stream compositions expected from the different combustion techniques currently available are discussed. The anticipated compositions are then related to a number of tentative CO2 stream compositions available in open literature proposed by research institutes and pipeline operators. In subsequent sections, early laboratory and field corrosion experience relating to natural dense-phase CO2 transport for the purposes of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are summarised along with more recent research efforts which focus on identifying the role of anthropogenic impurities in the degradation processes. For each system impurity, the reaction rates, mechanisms and corrosion product composition/morphology expected at the steel surfaces are discussed, as well as each component’s ability to influence the critical water content required to initiate corrosion. Potential bulk phase reactions between multiple impurities are also evaluated in an attempt to help understand how the impurity content may evolve along a long-distance pipeline. The likelihood of stress-corrosion cracking and hydrogen-induced cracking is discussed and the various corrosion mitigation techniques which exist to control degradation to acceptable levels are reviewed. Based on the current research performed in the context of impure dense-phase CO2 corrosion, issues associated with performing laboratory experiments to replicate field conditions and the challenges such limitations present in terms of defining the safe operating window for CO2 transport are considered. © 2016 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and ASM International.},

	abstract = {The surface of nuclear waste container will be completely wetted by the groundwater infiltrating through the bentonite or concrete buffer after the closure of its deep geological disposal. Because of its excellent corrosion resistance, titanium is one of the candidates for the container materials for high-level nuclear waste (HLNW) disposal. However, once oxygen depleted in the large time scale deep geological disposal, titanium container will suffer from hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Therefore, in order to predict the potential danger of the HLNW container caused by HE, the hydrogen entry into titanium was studied at different temperatures in simulated deep geological environment of Beishan, which is the preselected HLNW disposal area in China. Devanathan-Stachurski cell methods were firstly implemented in measuring apparent hydrogen diffusivity in titanium with hydrides being formed during hydrogen charging at low temperature ranges (298–373 K). Given the characteristic of the Devanathan-Stachurski cell method's capable of getting apparent diffusivity with combined influencing factors easily, the technique provides a simple way to measure the parameter that is necessary for the estimation of hydrogen penetration depth, facilitating the design of HLNW containers. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The second part of the review considers the suitability and optimisation of different metal hydrides based on their energy efficient thermal integration with fuel cells. The performances of metal hydrides are considered from the viewpoint of the reversible heat driven interaction of the metal hydrides with gaseous H2. Efficiencies of hydrogen and heat exchange in hydrogen stores to control H2 charge/discharge flow rates are the focus of the third section of the review and are considered together with metal hydride – fuel cell system integration issues and the corresponding engineering solutions.

	abstract = {Hydrogen production via steam methane reforming (SMR) dominates the supply to refining complexes worldwide, resulting in significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a considerable demand for clean hydrogen pathways that are economically competitive with SMR. The development of a 563 MW integrated wind-hydrogen model with energy storage is proposed. The model utilizes real-time wind energy data to ascertain the optimal size of the electrolyser, the number of electrolyser units and the battery (energy storage) capacity that will yield a minimum hydrogen production cost, whilst functioning in a liberalized electricity market with dynamic prices. The optimal plant configuration consists of 81 units of a 3496 kW (760 Nm3/hr) electrolyser and 360 MWh (60 units) of battery capacity. For the minimum hydrogen production cost determined ($9.00//kg H2), the wind farm accounts for 63% of this cost. Hence, if existing wind farm assets are used, such that the investment cost of building the wind-hydrogen plant does not include the wind farm costs, the hydrogen production cost is reduced to $3.37/kg H2. For a particular electrolyser-battery configuration, it was observed that the minimum hydrogen production cost occurs when their respective capacity factors are approximately equivalent. The benefits of energy storage are limited by the decrease in overall plant efficiency, which results from the use of the battery. For the techno-economic conditions considered in this paper, hydrogen production costs from wind powered electrolysis ($3.37 to $9.00/kg H2) are uncompetitive with SMR/SMR-CCS ($1.87 to $2.60/kg H2). © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.},

	abstract = {The storage of hydrogen energy is one of the key difficulties in the efficient use of hydrogen. The most important thing for different storage methods is to establish the aisles of the hydrogen to storage space, and efficiently drill a few high-quality well holes. Compound drilling is one of the alternative technologies. However, the bit-rock interaction and the drill string-borehole interaction make the movement of bottom hold assembly more complex and increase the difficulty of well trajectory control. The vibration characteristics of drill string during compound drilling are not clear. The numerical simulation model of drill string with positive displacement motor is established by considering the bit-rock interaction, the rock failure behavior, the drill string-borehole interaction and the drill string structural. The mechanical parameters of shale for the numerical model are measured by wave velocities method. The simulation model is verified by the measuring and motoring data of axial force in the field. The rock element damage failure rate of compound drilling is greater than conventional drilling. The axial force and torque of bit of drill string in compound drilling is greater than that in the conventional drilling. The drill string is in contact with the wellbore in a more complicated way during compound drilling. The research results are benefit for optimal design of borehole quality. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {                             The use of hydrogen as a non-emission energy carrier is important for the innovative development of the power-generation industry. Transmission pipelines are the most efficient and economic method of transporting large quantities of hydrogen in a number of variants. A comprehensive hydraulic analysis of hydrogen transmission at a mass flow rate of 0.3 to 3.0 kg/s (volume flow rates from 12,000 Nm                             3                             /h to 120,000 Nm                             3                             /h) was performed. The methodology was based on flow simulation in a pipeline for assumed boundary conditions as well as modeling of fluid thermodynamic parameters for pure hydrogen and its mixtures with methane. The assumed outlet pressure was 24 bar (g). The pipeline diameter and required inlet pressure were calculated for these parameters. The change in temperature was analyzed as a function of the pipeline length for a given real heat transfer model; the assumed temperatures were 5 and 25                             ◦                             C. The impact of hydrogen on natural gas transmission is another important issue. The performed analysis revealed that the maximum participation of hydrogen in natural gas should not exceed 15%–20%, or it has a negative impact on natural gas quality. In the case of a mixture of 85% methane and 15% hydrogen, the required outlet pressure is 10% lower than for pure methane. The obtained results present various possibilities of pipeline transmission of hydrogen at large distances. Moreover, the changes in basic thermodynamic parameters have been presented as a function of pipeline length for the adopted assumptions.                          © 2019 by the authors},

	abstract = {The world's richest renewable energy resources - of large geographic extent and high intensity - are stranded: far from end-users with inadequate or nonexistent gathering and transmission systems to deliver the energy. The energy output of most renewables varies greatly, at time scales of seconds to seasons: the energy capture assets thus operate at inherently low capacity factor (CF); energy delivery to end-users is not "firm". New electric transmission systems, or fractions thereof, dedicated to renewables, will suffer the same low CF, and represent substantial stranded capital assets, which increases the cost of delivered renewable-source energy. Electric energy storage cannot affordably firm large renewables at annual scale. At gigawatt (GW = 1,000 MW) scale, renewable-source electricity from diverse sources, worldwide, can be converted to hydrogen and oxygen, via high-pressure-output electrolyzers, with the hydrogen pipelined to load centers (cities, refineries, chemical plants) for use as vehicle fuel, combined-heat-and-power generation on the retail side of the customers' meters, ammonia production, and petroleum refinery feedstock. The oxygen byproduct may be sold to adjacent dry biomass and / or coal gasification plants. Figures 1 - 3. New, large, solution-mined salt caverns in the southern Great Plains, and probably elsewhere in the world, may economically store enough energy as compressed gaseous hydrogen (GH2) to "firm" renewables at annual scale, adding great market and strategic value to diverse, stranded, rich, renewable resources. Figures 2 and 3. For example, Great Plains, USA, wind energy, if fully harvested and "firmed" and transmitted to markets, could supply the entire energy consumption of USA. If gathered, transmitted, and delivered as hydrogen, about 15,000 new solution-mined salt caverns, of ∼8 million cubic feet (225,000 cubic meters) each, would be required, at an incremental.

	abstract = {Within 40 years the world will be depending heavily on three energy sources, which are all badly suited for distribution and consumer use. Load levelling and storage are uneconomical with nuclear power and especially with solar energy. With the exception of coal they are, however, clean and environmentally acceptable for large-scale use. The solution to this problem is to use a secondary energy-carrier system, which has to be able to connect economically scattered consumer locations to their supply centres. It will also have to provide a means of storage to smooth out demand and supply and also be compatible with the end-user requirements. Hydrogen is compatible with future energy sources, with other secondary energy carriers as well as with most end user requirements. This means it can easily be produced from water, the original energy being derived from either fossil fuels, e. g. nuclear, solar, geothermal, wind etc. Hydrogen energy can be transformed into electricity by fuel cells or generators coupled to gas turbines as well as regenerated from electricity by water electrolysis. It can be burned to yield hot water for district heating. End users can get electrical, mechanical, chemical or thermal energy from hydrogen by using fuel cells, internal-combustion engines, turbines, chemical reactors or burners. Hydrogen can be stored as a gas (bottled or underground), a liquid (cryogenic tanks) or in a solid form (metal hydrides). It can be distributed by the conventional and partly existing infrastructure of today's natural gas transportation and distribution pipe system with only minor modifications. The introduction of hydrogen as a main energy carrier is more an economic than a technical problem. Being a secondary energy carrier hydrogen will always be more expensive than the primary energy sources from which it has to be produced. It will play a major role only after the oil and gas era, which means after the year 2000. The earliest breakthroughs will occur in countries with no or few fossil energy resources and which have to turn to nuclear and solar energy first. After the year 2020, hydrogen will become a major energy carrier in many parts of the world.},

The study is based on a techno-economic model in which the net present value (NPV) method and Monte Carlo simulation of risks and price forward curves for the electricity and the gas market are used. We study three investment cases: A Base Case where the gas is directly sold in the market, a Storage & Arbitrage Case where temporal arbitrage opportunities between the electricity and the gas market are exploited, and a Storage & Balancing Case where the balancing markets (secondary reserve market for electricity, external balancing market for natural gas) are addressed. The optimal type and size of different centralized and decentralized storage facilities are determined and compared with each other. In a detailed sensitivity and cost analysis, we identify the key factors which could potentially improve the economic viability of the technological concepts assessed. We find that the P2G system used for bridging the balancing markets for power and gas cannot be operated profitably. For both, temporal arbitrage and balancing energy, pipe storage is preferred. Relatively high feed-in tariffs (100 € MW-1 for hydrogen, 130 € MW-1 for methane) are required to render pipe storage for P2G economically viable. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Demands for space and water heating constitute a significant proportion of the total energy demands in Great Britain and are predominantly satisfied through natural gas, which makes the heat sector a large emitter of carbon dioxide. Renewable hydrogen, which can be injected into the gas grid or used directly in processes for generating heat and/or electricity, is being considered as a low-carbon alternative energy carrier to natural gas because of its suitability for large-scale, long- and short-term storage and low transportation losses, all of which help to overcome the intermittency and seasonal variations in renewables. This requires new infrastructures for production, storage, transport and utilisation of renewable hydrogen – a hydrogen value chain – the design of which involves many interdependent decisions, such as: where to locate wind turbines; where to locate electrolysers, close to wind generation or close to demands; whether to transport energy as electricity or hydrogen, and how; where to locate storage facilities; etc. This paper presents the Value Web Model, a novel and comprehensive spatio-temporal mixed-integer linear programming model that can simultaneously optimise the design, planning and operation of integrated energy value chains, accounting for short-term dynamics, inter-seasonal storage and investments out to 2050. It was coupled with GIS modelling to identify candidate sites for wind generation and used to optimise a number of scenarios for the production of hydrogen, from onshore and offshore wind turbines, in order to satisfy heat demands. The results show that over a wide range of scenarios, the optimal pathway to heat is roughly 20% hydrogen and 80% electricity. Hydrogen storage, both in underground caverns and pressurised tanks, is a key enabling technology. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {The explicit tendency to increase the power generation from stochastic renewable resources forces to look for technological solutions of energy management and storage. In the recent years, the concept of power-to-gas, where the excess energy is converted into hydrogen and/or further methanized into renewable methane, is gaining high popularity among researchers. In this study, we assess the power-to-renewable methane system as the potential technology for power grid balancing. For the assessment, a mathematical model has been developed that assists in understanding of whether a power-to-renewable methane system can be developed in a region with specific installed and planned capacities of wind energy and biogas plants. Considering the varying amount of excess power available for H2 production and the varying biogas quality, the aim of the model is to simulate the system to determine, if wind power generation meets the needs of biogas plants for storing the excess energy in the form of methane via the methanation process. For the case study, the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) have been selected, as the region is characterized by high dependence on fossil energy sources and electricity import. The results show that with the wind power produced in the region it would be possible to increase the average CH4 content in the methanized biogas by up to 48.4%. Yet, even with a positive H2 net production rate, not in all cases the maximum possible quality of the renewable methane would be achieved, as at moments the necessary amount of H2 for methanation would not be readily available, and the reaction would not be possible. Thus, in the region, the wind power capacities would not meet the biogas plant capacities nor now, nor until 2020. For the system's development, two potential pathways are seen as possible for balancing the regions' power grid. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {New techniques and methods for energy storage are required for the transition to a renewable power supply, termed “Energiewende” in Germany. Energy storage in the geological subsurface provides large potential capacities to bridge temporal gaps between periods of production of solar or wind power and consumer demand and may also help to relieve the power grids. Storage options include storage of synthetic methane, hydrogen or compressed air in salt caverns or porous formations as well as heat storage in porous formations. In the ANGUS+ project, heat and gas storage in porous media and salt caverns and aspects of their use on subsurface spatial planning concepts are investigated. The optimal dimensioning of storage sites, the achievable charging and discharging rates and the effective storage capacity as well as the induced thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, geochemical and microbial effects are studied. The geological structures, the surface energy infrastructure and the governing processes are parameterized, using either literature data or own experimental studies. Numerical modeling tools are developed for the simulation of realistically defined synthetic storage scenarios. The feasible dimensioning of storage applications is assessed in site-specific numerical scenario analyses, and the related spatial extents and time scales of induced effects connected with the respective storage application are quantified. Additionally, geophysical monitoring methods, which allow for a better spatial resolution of the storage operation, induced effects or leakages, are evaluated based on these scenario simulations. Methods for the assessment of such subsurface geological storage sites are thus developed, which account for the spatial extension of the subsurface operation itself as well as its induced effects and the spatial requirements of adequate monitoring methods. © 2016, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A review of more than 60 studies (plus more than 65 studies on P2G) on power and energy models based on simulation and optimization was done. Based on these, for power systems with up to 95% renewables, the electricity storage size is found to be below 1.5% of the annual demand (in energy terms). While for 100% renewables energy systems (power, heat, mobility), it can remain below 6% of the annual energy demand. Combination of sectors and diverting the electricity to another sector can play a large role in reducing the storage size. From the potential alternatives to satisfy this demand, pumped hydro storage (PHS) global potential is not enough and new technologies with a higher energy density are needed. Hydrogen, with more than 250 times the energy density of PHS is a potential option to satisfy the storage need. However, changes needed in infrastructure to deal with high hydrogen content and the suitability of salt caverns for its storage can pose limitations for this technology. Power to Gas (P2G) arises as possible alternative overcoming both the facilities and the energy density issues. The global storage requirement would represent only 2% of the global annual natural gas production or 10% of the gas storage facilities (in energy equivalent). The more options considered to deal with intermittent sources, the lower the storage requirement will be. Therefore, future studies aiming to quantify storage needs should focus on the entire energy system including technology vectors (e.g. Power to Heat, Liquid, Gas, Chemicals) to avoid overestimating the amount of storage needed. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {The study analyzes the techno-economic feasibility and business case of large-scale hydrogen underground storage in France. Potential regions for locating the storage cavity were assessed, as well as the anticipated hydrogen demand and renewable energy developments. The business case of salt caverns storage facility has been assessed both in 2025 and 2050, looking at several demand sectors, including mobility (FCEVs), hydrogen-consuming industries and what is defined as “Power-to-Gas”. The hourly operation of the cavern has been modeled. The electricity supply is restricted to wind and grid electricity only. The mobility market is clearly the key driver, both in quantity and economic terms, with an easier to achieve target cost (€4/kgH2, ex-storage). High utilization rates of electrolysers are necessary to reach profitability. A need for massive storage begins for a renewable penetration rate of 50%. The hydrogen costs varies from €4.5/kg to €6.6/kg H2, and the underground mass storage cost remains always under 5% of the overall costs. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},
